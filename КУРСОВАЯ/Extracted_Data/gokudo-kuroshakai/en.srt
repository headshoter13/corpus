1
00:00:12,739 --> 00:00:16,641
No species compares to man.

2
00:00:16,743 --> 00:00:20,645
Even wolves don't hunt
their own kind...

3
00:00:20,747 --> 00:00:25,707
but man is capable of
devouring each other alive.

4
00:00:49,275 --> 00:00:54,338
Hey, Riki, catch it like a man.

5
00:01:04,491 --> 00:01:08,450
You threw it too hard, Ryu.

6
00:01:17,737 --> 00:01:19,728
Hi.

7
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,146
Sir, one of our dealers in Kobe
on the phone.

8
00:01:31,251 --> 00:01:33,549
It's me.

9
00:01:33,686 --> 00:01:39,989
Got anything yet?
- Much more than just anything.

10
00:01:42,428 --> 00:01:46,057
Kobe seems to have made a deal with Korea.

11
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,483
Mountain.

12
00:02:47,026 --> 00:02:48,653
River.

13
00:04:00,633 --> 00:04:05,570
Hey, old man.

14
00:04:28,594 --> 00:04:30,084
Sir...

15
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:33,130
Our dealer has been killed by the Yasha-gang.

16
00:04:33,266 --> 00:04:36,235
So they beat us to it.

17
00:04:36,369 --> 00:04:38,769
That son of a bitch Nohma.

18
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:43,936
An eye for an eye.

19
00:05:08,368 --> 00:05:13,305
Daigen Nohma - the fifth great leader
of the Yasha-gang

20
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,742
Excuse me.

21
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,369
Come on in.

22
00:05:26,753 --> 00:05:30,154
A package from our dealer in Hakata.

23
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:53,471
The Nioh-temple (a.k.a. The Drug-temple)

24
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,282
This is bad.

25
00:07:12,325 --> 00:07:14,384
Very bad.

26
00:07:15,228 --> 00:07:26,162
I have no excuse
for what my son Ryu has done.

27
00:07:27,306 --> 00:07:31,299
People are screaming for
a large-scale war against us.

28
00:07:34,514 --> 00:07:40,282
Should the Yasha-gang come to Kyoto now...

29
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:44,480
we're finished. Right?

30
00:07:46,225 --> 00:07:50,059
The Nioh-family is finished.

31
00:07:59,405 --> 00:08:02,806
What are you going to do, Mr. Fudoh?

32
00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:21,752
I'll...

33
00:08:23,663 --> 00:08:27,963
I'll take full responsibility.

34
00:08:39,312 --> 00:08:43,476
This feast is for the attack
of the Fudoh-family.

35
00:08:43,616 --> 00:08:44,548
Ryu...

36
00:08:44,684 --> 00:08:49,587
Father, the Yasha attacked us first.

37
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:57,395
So you're saying
a war cannot be prevented?

38
00:09:09,575 --> 00:09:11,042
Ryu...

39
00:09:14,213 --> 00:09:19,378
Don't die, whatever happens.

40
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,656
Hey, just eat.

41
00:09:30,796 --> 00:09:32,957
Thank you for this meal.

42
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:35,416
Fudoh, you'd take responsibility.

43
00:11:35,554 --> 00:11:38,887
Tell us what your plan is.

44
00:11:39,024 --> 00:11:43,654
Where is he? I don't see him.

45
00:11:50,536 --> 00:11:54,267
Because he is your son,
he can get away with it?

46
00:11:54,406 --> 00:12:01,835
If that's the case,
you'll loose more than just a finger.

47
00:12:03,716 --> 00:12:05,581
My finger?

48
00:12:05,718 --> 00:12:07,777
No, your arm.

49
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,256
Your apology to Yasha
will cost you an arm.

50
00:12:18,464 --> 00:12:21,194
I don't think that will be necessary.

51
00:12:23,803 --> 00:12:26,237
What?

52
00:12:26,372 --> 00:12:30,809
This should end our conflict.

53
00:13:56,395 --> 00:13:58,556
You're leaving, sir?

54
00:14:03,102 --> 00:14:05,662
I'm going to see the mayor.

55
00:14:07,673 --> 00:14:09,641
I understand.

56
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:15,872
Did I forget anything?

57
00:14:17,616 --> 00:14:22,485
Ryu's funeral will be soon.

58
00:14:22,621 --> 00:14:27,285
Is that so? I forgot.

59
00:14:27,426 --> 00:14:29,621
It's the tenth birthday.

60
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:35,166
Ten years?

61
00:14:35,301 --> 00:14:39,670
It's already been ten years?

62
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:48,161
Hey, kid. Don't you have school today?

63
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,760
That's not right.
You've got a beautiful feature ahead of you.

64
00:17:22,668 --> 00:17:24,067
Here.

65
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:26,762
Come.

66
00:17:26,905 --> 00:17:31,774
Ryuji Komoku, council member of the Kyushu
Nioh Group, died on July 13 at 7.42 hours.

67
00:17:32,144 --> 00:17:39,141
Officers, this is such a waste
of the taxpayer's money.

68
00:17:39,284 --> 00:17:42,481
Shut up.

69
00:17:42,621 --> 00:17:46,955
Sir, we're going to buy some gas. Ok?

70
00:17:52,731 --> 00:17:55,063
Welcome.

71
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,135
I have to piss.
- Thank you for buying gas here.

72
00:18:05,144 --> 00:18:08,875
Welcome. Coffee on the house. Please.

73
00:18:09,014 --> 00:18:10,504
Thank you.

74
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:14,575
Here.

75
00:18:23,662 --> 00:18:26,187
Jesus, how gross.

76
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:30,368
Hey, what's up with you?

77
00:18:31,603 --> 00:18:35,562
Hey, are you alright?

78
00:18:37,009 --> 00:18:39,068
What's wrong?

79
00:18:41,446 --> 00:18:43,607
What's this?

80
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:46,479
I don't know.
- What's happening?

81
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:52,750
My god...

82
00:19:15,981 --> 00:19:24,218
Akira Jikoku, council member of the Kyushu
Nioh Group, died on July 13 at 10.08 hours.

83
00:19:25,524 --> 00:19:28,982
Filthy dog, trying to sneak away?

84
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:39,896
Thank you, it was delicious.

85
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:46,705
What's that supposed to mean?
What are you up to?

86
00:19:46,845 --> 00:19:50,178
Do you think you can just run away?

87
00:20:11,069 --> 00:20:15,904
College for Economics - Nakasu

88
00:20:47,773 --> 00:20:57,273
'Only asked' will be part of the exam,
so you better prepare it well.

89
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:04,386
Also 'she doesn't seem
all that sad to me'...

90
00:21:09,127 --> 00:21:10,958
You idiot.

91
00:21:13,665 --> 00:21:21,265
How dare you listen to
this junk in class.

92
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,258
Fudoh...

93
00:21:43,362 --> 00:21:45,990
Meet me in the conference room.

94
00:21:48,066 --> 00:21:49,431
Yes, sir.

95
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:54,337
Rise.

96
00:22:10,255 --> 00:22:16,888
Mr. Aizome, I hope you'll soon
get used to your new school.

97
00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:39,979
Who's that guy?
- That's one of your classmates, Riki Fudoh.

98
00:22:40,118 --> 00:22:41,847
Big name, small guy.

99
00:22:41,987 --> 00:22:46,321
He's our best student,
so you better become friends.

100
00:23:28,467 --> 00:23:32,995
Here's three million yen.
Consider it an advance payment.

101
00:23:33,138 --> 00:23:36,403
I'll get the rest next week, I swear.

102
00:23:48,987 --> 00:23:50,511
I'm sorry.

103
00:23:50,655 --> 00:23:56,685
Ten million is a lot for a teacher.
I couldn't get everything so soon.

104
00:23:56,828 --> 00:24:03,131
Mr. Arita, you were the 
one asking for drugs.

105
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:13,670
If you commit suicide
that's also fine by me.

106
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:31,527
What the fuck is happing 
with this place?

107
00:24:31,663 --> 00:24:34,655
Shut up, stupid idiot.

108
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:39,668
Every massaging parlour in Nakasu
knows what happened yesterday.

109
00:24:39,804 --> 00:24:43,706
What happened?
- You refused to pay...

110
00:24:43,775 --> 00:24:47,768
and you put all girls in the hospital
with your elephant sized dick.

111
00:24:47,913 --> 00:24:50,507
You want some too?

112
00:25:18,343 --> 00:25:23,872
Who's that little boy?
- I'd watch my mouth.

113
00:25:24,015 --> 00:25:27,473
That's young Fudoh.
He runs everything in and around Nakasu.

114
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:30,386
What?

115
00:25:32,123 --> 00:25:33,784
Young?

116
00:25:36,027 --> 00:25:37,688
Yakuza?

117
00:27:15,293 --> 00:27:19,161
That's some hot chick, no?

118
00:27:19,297 --> 00:27:24,758
Most strippers are
burned out porn stars...

119
00:27:26,438 --> 00:27:30,135
But she's got real talent.

120
00:28:03,341 --> 00:28:08,244
Toru Ando, council member of the Kyushu
Nioh Group, died on July 14 at 20:52 hours.

121
00:28:08,913 --> 00:28:16,149
'Those who don't leave
with the elements...'

122
00:28:20,058 --> 00:28:25,325
'but settle in,
are the first ones to leave.'

123
00:28:25,463 --> 00:28:29,058
This sentence is from the classic
'Thurezure gusa'.

124
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:35,070
As you know, in this book...

125
00:29:07,739 --> 00:29:11,402
They're very good this year.

126
00:29:11,543 --> 00:29:13,704
Hello?

127
00:29:13,845 --> 00:29:18,441
Boss. It's The Uncle, from Ehime

128
00:29:22,787 --> 00:29:26,382
What's the matter?

129
00:29:26,524 --> 00:29:28,685
Is that so?

130
00:29:28,827 --> 00:29:31,853
You have some purifying water?

131
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:39,134
Fine. Open it.

132
00:29:46,511 --> 00:29:48,979
Good morning, sir.

133
00:30:21,546 --> 00:30:25,004
Your blood is the purifying water.

134
00:30:31,155 --> 00:30:36,092
Tobatsu, council member of the Kyushu
Nioh Group, died in the morning of July 14.

135
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:41,123
This is bad.

136
00:30:44,636 --> 00:30:46,831
Very bad.

137
00:30:48,373 --> 00:30:56,974
It's a pity we can't give
them a decent burial.

138
00:30:58,049 --> 00:31:05,012
And I rather not call in 
the gangs of the mainland.

139
00:31:05,156 --> 00:31:10,150
Those four knew more than anyone.

140
00:31:10,295 --> 00:31:12,263
Right, father?

141
00:31:15,967 --> 00:31:21,200
I was planning an emergency meeting...

142
00:31:21,339 --> 00:31:29,405
but you two are the only ones
we can really trust.

143
00:31:35,653 --> 00:31:46,188
We should quit guarding those
old men like statues.

144
00:31:46,331 --> 00:31:47,628
Yes.

145
00:31:51,302 --> 00:31:55,534
Even though they're only for show...

146
00:31:55,707 --> 00:32:00,838
those Nioh-statues near the altar
are scarier than those old men.

147
00:32:11,122 --> 00:32:18,324
Whoever killed the council members,
is probably thinking the same as I am.

148
00:32:28,573 --> 00:32:32,566
History has been written.

149
00:32:32,744 --> 00:32:35,713
Everything falls into place.

150
00:32:37,448 --> 00:32:39,848
The fittest always survive.

151
00:32:52,363 --> 00:32:56,197
That's how the world works.

152
00:33:27,665 --> 00:33:33,604
Every time you make a phone call,
someone dies in Hakata.

153
00:33:33,738 --> 00:33:38,232
What the fuck are you up to?

154
00:33:39,944 --> 00:33:42,242
Akira Aizome.

155
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:50,983
Born in Osaka, on April 1 1976.

156
00:33:51,122 --> 00:33:55,422
2,5 years of reform school
due to violent behaviour.

157
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:59,519
The first charge
was the murder of your own parents...

158
00:33:59,664 --> 00:34:02,656
but you were acquitted
because of your age.

159
00:34:07,805 --> 00:34:11,866
Hold on a moment.

160
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:13,806
Answer my question.

161
00:34:14,645 --> 00:34:27,683
Step aside. Get out of my way, I said.

162
00:34:33,731 --> 00:34:36,029
Now that's a broad.

163
00:34:42,473 --> 00:34:45,340
Sorry, I just got my period.

164
00:34:49,447 --> 00:34:53,577
If you want to know more, follow me.

165
00:35:47,939 --> 00:35:51,500
You want me to play football
with those kids?

166
00:36:15,243 --> 00:36:17,643
The English teacher.

167
00:36:30,147 --> 00:36:31,637
He's flat.

168
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:57,303
Nothing to joke about actually.

169
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:03,168
Now.

170
00:37:18,029 --> 00:37:20,293
It's pretty fun after all.

171
00:37:29,206 --> 00:37:35,975
Now I get it.
You got rid of those council members.

172
00:37:38,649 --> 00:37:44,451
A corpse will stiffen, unless the blood
is replaced by new blood.

173
00:37:48,192 --> 00:37:53,630
The Nioh Group is finished
because they're satisfied with Kyushu.

174
00:37:53,764 --> 00:37:56,392
That sounds boring. I'm leaving.

175
00:38:01,005 --> 00:38:02,597
Pang.

176
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:08,076
If you wanted to kill me,
I'd already be dead.

177
00:38:08,212 --> 00:38:10,271
What are you waiting for?

178
00:38:13,718 --> 00:38:21,215
A big tree is too conspicuous,
a big forest on the other hand...

179
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:29,164
Just like the wind, you feel it
but you can't see it.

180
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:37,867
Soon the blue wind will blow,
and move the big forest.

181
00:38:40,644 --> 00:38:45,547
I don't know what you want anymore, but
it's more than a local gang war.

182
00:38:51,322 --> 00:38:57,158
Aizome, you want to see the fireworks?
- Fireworks?

183
00:38:57,294 --> 00:39:02,027
An attack.
- An attack on the Yasha-gang?

184
00:39:04,702 --> 00:39:06,602
The Nioh-temple.

185
00:39:35,399 --> 00:39:37,128
Good evening.

186
00:39:39,069 --> 00:39:40,559
Young Fudoh.

187
00:39:42,139 --> 00:39:44,403
What do you want with that sword?

188
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:48,745
It's my brother's birthday,
of his death.

189
00:39:48,879 --> 00:39:53,248
I want to put this in his grave.

190
00:39:53,384 --> 00:39:55,113
As you wish, sir.

191
00:41:47,665 --> 00:41:49,292
Who is it?

192
00:42:05,149 --> 00:42:09,745
Oh, it's Riki.
What are you doing here at this hour?

193
00:42:21,932 --> 00:42:25,993
Fudoh's kid. What's going on here?

194
00:42:33,844 --> 00:42:37,371
I have your father's balls.

195
00:42:38,882 --> 00:42:41,248
No one will take them away from me.
- Die.

196
00:43:31,402 --> 00:43:34,963
Now I'm in total control of Kyushu.

197
00:43:35,105 --> 00:43:36,436
Mr. Fudoh.

198
00:43:41,812 --> 00:43:45,145
You seem to be in a big hurry.

199
00:43:45,282 --> 00:43:51,585
I'm replacing Mr. Arita.
I'm the new English teacher.

200
00:43:51,722 --> 00:43:53,747
What do you mean?

201
00:44:01,331 --> 00:44:05,768
You have to wait your turn.

202
00:44:05,869 --> 00:44:08,770
Stop beating around the bush.

203
00:44:08,972 --> 00:44:11,805
Tell me how things stand.

204
00:44:11,942 --> 00:44:14,877
Just watch your own head.

205
00:44:17,481 --> 00:44:21,975
If you want things too fast, you
don't notice the things around you.

206
00:44:25,456 --> 00:44:28,152
I'm Jun Miroku. Pleased to meet you.

207
00:44:28,292 --> 00:44:33,662
My motto has always been:
get them before they get you.

208
00:44:33,797 --> 00:44:41,329
The day we run this country together,
is not far off, Mr. Nohma.

209
00:44:41,472 --> 00:44:46,774
It's not just this country.

210
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:50,641
Hey, you there.

211
00:44:50,781 --> 00:44:54,945
This is my class.
You better listen to me.

212
00:45:01,625 --> 00:45:07,894
Sorry, but I'm on the phone.
It's alright. You can go on.

213
00:45:08,031 --> 00:45:13,059
Ms. Miroku, he's bad.
- He's a genius.

214
00:45:25,916 --> 00:45:29,511
Audio-Visual Room

215
00:45:37,661 --> 00:45:42,655
The Nioh Groeu and the Yasha-gang
have merged completely.

216
00:45:47,771 --> 00:45:50,433
What's Nohma's final goal?

217
00:45:52,709 --> 00:45:56,975
He's been to North Korea often.

218
00:45:57,114 --> 00:46:04,486
His organisation steals military data
from the Japanese government.

219
00:46:06,223 --> 00:46:08,521
Not only for himself.

220
00:46:10,327 --> 00:46:14,263
But also for North Korea.

221
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:21,836
Nohma made a deal with them
to wage a war against the V.S...

222
00:46:28,579 --> 00:46:31,548
My father has been brainwashed by Nohma.

223
00:46:34,251 --> 00:46:36,776
He does Nohma's bidding.

224
00:46:49,166 --> 00:46:51,828
I can't allow Nohma 
to do as he pleases.

225
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:11,079
You are an enthusiastic teacher.

226
00:48:21,458 --> 00:48:23,392
Your older brother?

227
00:48:56,026 --> 00:48:57,516
Mr. Fudoh.

228
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:03,964
Vengeance just begets more vengeance.

229
00:49:07,237 --> 00:49:08,898
Ms. Miroku.

230
00:49:13,377 --> 00:49:14,776
Ms. Miroku...

231
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:19,580
What do you want from me?

232
00:49:31,361 --> 00:49:33,090
What do you mean?

233
00:49:53,984 --> 00:49:59,354
My brother's blood 
is on this sword.

234
00:50:04,828 --> 00:50:09,788
I'll make sure no more
innocent blood is spilled.

235
00:52:53,863 --> 00:52:56,331
Wasn't this a great present?

236
00:52:59,236 --> 00:53:05,664
Maybe I'll join you
if you solve your problems.

237
00:53:05,809 --> 00:53:11,270
Immediately. I'll take of it this instance.

238
00:53:11,414 --> 00:53:16,716
It won't be the same
as with your oldest son.

239
00:53:18,688 --> 00:53:22,317
Your son is tougher than you think.

240
00:53:24,661 --> 00:53:29,598
I'm eagerly looking forward
to his severed head.

241
00:55:02,092 --> 00:55:03,491
Aboji.

242
00:55:41,398 --> 00:55:43,332
Thank you.

243
00:55:52,776 --> 00:55:55,108
I'm here to ask you for a favour.

244
00:55:57,747 --> 00:56:00,841
It's an honour
to serve you, father.

245
00:56:03,586 --> 00:56:05,144
Gon.

246
00:56:07,157 --> 00:56:17,692
The Yasha didn't kill 
the council of Nioh.

247
00:56:20,136 --> 00:56:28,805
I wanted an alliance with the Yasha.

248
00:56:30,713 --> 00:56:37,243
But someone is interfering.
- Who then?

249
00:56:40,123 --> 00:56:42,318
My son.

250
00:56:47,096 --> 00:56:52,261
He's probably at school right now.

251
00:56:52,402 --> 00:57:00,275
You want me to expose of your own son?
Your own flesh and blood?

252
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:03,607
You want me to kill my half-brother?

253
00:57:08,918 --> 00:57:11,079
I'm counting on you.

254
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:15,289
Eat something.

255
00:57:45,989 --> 00:57:47,684
I'm sorry, but...

256
00:57:48,858 --> 00:57:50,291
Sir...

257
00:57:51,694 --> 00:57:52,854
You're not allowed in here.

258
00:57:52,996 --> 00:57:56,022
You call this kimchee?
- Marinated Japanese style.

259
00:58:21,724 --> 00:58:24,557
Thank you. Thank you very much.

260
00:59:15,044 --> 00:59:17,478
Here's the next one.

261
00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:24,147
It's too much.

262
00:59:29,525 --> 00:59:32,983
Sir, please, it's too much.

263
00:59:36,566 --> 00:59:42,061
He passed out.
- What a sissy.

264
00:59:42,205 --> 00:59:43,900
Hey, you.

265
00:59:49,812 --> 00:59:52,872
Rather childish, don't you think?

266
00:59:54,917 --> 00:59:56,817
Childish?

267
00:59:58,921 --> 01:00:00,752
Shut your mouth.

268
01:00:02,325 --> 01:00:03,849
Go away.

269
01:00:13,469 --> 01:00:20,204
I'm your gym teacher
for this semester, Akihiro Gondo.

270
01:00:20,343 --> 01:00:21,742
Pleased to meet you.

271
01:00:38,227 --> 01:00:39,660
You there...

272
01:00:41,964 --> 01:00:46,060
Where's the teacher's lounge?
- First floor.

273
01:00:46,202 --> 01:00:47,692
Thank you.

274
01:00:47,837 --> 01:00:53,571
Would Mr. Fudoh report to the
conference room?

275
01:00:53,710 --> 01:00:55,541
Excuse me.

276
01:00:59,949 --> 01:01:04,010
What's wrong?
- Aizome's motor has been blown up.

277
01:01:04,153 --> 01:01:07,054
He's with our doctor.

278
01:02:11,821 --> 01:02:14,619
Mr. Gondo, no?

279
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:21,963
What do you want?

280
01:02:40,550 --> 01:02:42,313
Korean pickles.

281
01:02:54,897 --> 01:03:01,166
Mr. Gondo, forget what you saw,
or else...

282
01:03:05,041 --> 01:03:08,477
you can jump down.

283
01:03:08,611 --> 01:03:10,442
What would you prefer?

284
01:03:12,849 --> 01:03:15,647
Is something funny?

285
01:03:15,785 --> 01:03:21,087
After Aizome it's your turn,
Touko Zenzai.

286
01:04:26,522 --> 01:04:29,616
That's disgusting, dirty whore.

287
01:04:47,243 --> 01:04:53,671
We've got some bad news 
for you this morning.

288
01:04:53,816 --> 01:04:59,482
Ms. Touko Zenzai of class 2-E
has passed away last night.

289
01:05:02,325 --> 01:05:11,859
Why did such a popular and 
smart girl commit suicide?

290
01:05:12,001 --> 01:05:14,435
It's a real pity.

291
01:05:19,041 --> 01:05:26,174
One victim after another.
Right, boss?

292
01:05:28,818 --> 01:05:31,912
Just like an ordinary Yakuza-gang.

293
01:05:49,038 --> 01:05:51,370
This is for Ms. Zenzai.

294
01:06:04,954 --> 01:06:07,115
A moment of silence please.

295
01:06:16,899 --> 01:06:21,598
Don't worry. Act normal.

296
01:06:30,679 --> 01:06:32,476
Understand?

297
01:07:19,161 --> 01:07:23,928
I was shocked
to see you doing this work.

298
01:07:26,268 --> 01:07:29,795
What of it?

299
01:07:29,939 --> 01:07:35,468
I wanted to ask you about 
your relation with Fudoh.

300
01:07:36,378 --> 01:07:38,175
Who are you?

301
01:07:40,382 --> 01:07:43,476
First I want to ask you something?

302
01:07:46,789 --> 01:07:49,280
Would it be ok if I took a shower here?

303
01:07:55,664 --> 01:07:57,427
A shower?

304
01:08:46,182 --> 01:08:54,612
It only appears when my skin
gets warm. It's my secret.

305
01:08:57,526 --> 01:09:00,495
No one knows my secret.

306
01:09:04,667 --> 01:09:12,335
Ms. Miroku, you want to know my secret?

307
01:10:01,123 --> 01:10:03,489
Surprised?

308
01:10:03,626 --> 01:10:08,757
You are...
- Yes, I'm a hermaphrodite.

309
01:10:25,547 --> 01:10:31,110
I'm both male and female.

310
01:10:31,253 --> 01:10:36,987
I have to learn and live with it.

311
01:12:08,384 --> 01:12:20,319
Ms. Miroku, I know I can never
be happy.

312
01:14:06,468 --> 01:14:09,369
That's our old Mika again.

313
01:15:34,222 --> 01:15:42,220
Mr. Fudoh...
- Mika, don't try to talk.

314
01:15:43,565 --> 01:15:49,970
Go... Gondo...

315
01:16:08,991 --> 01:16:10,856
Gondo.

316
01:18:31,533 --> 01:18:36,334
Fudoh. Where is Fudoh?

317
01:18:36,471 --> 01:18:38,268
Mr. Aizome...

318
01:18:40,909 --> 01:18:45,642
You're all going to die.
- And who are you, Ms. Miroku?

319
01:19:49,344 --> 01:19:53,747
It's too late. Mr. Gondo.

320
01:19:56,051 --> 01:19:57,985
Is something the matter, Mr. Fudoh?

321
01:20:01,523 --> 01:20:03,787
I'm here to see how you're doing.

322
01:20:08,463 --> 01:20:12,160
Not many students do that.

323
01:20:16,671 --> 01:20:18,502
Nice apartment.

324
01:20:21,109 --> 01:20:25,170
With my salary I can't
to be too picky.

325
01:20:33,488 --> 01:20:36,719
Mr. Gondo...

326
01:20:36,858 --> 01:20:39,383
my father probably sent you.

327
01:20:45,567 --> 01:20:48,866
Your real name is Won Myonbak.

328
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:54,700
Ex-secret agent
for the Korean army.

329
01:21:00,548 --> 01:21:03,142
Lovechild of Iwao Fudoh.

330
01:21:06,521 --> 01:21:13,950
You may call me 'big brother'.

331
01:21:22,237 --> 01:21:28,870
Mr. Gondo, do you know the Moonriver?

332
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:31,911
The Moonriver?

333
01:21:32,047 --> 01:21:41,683
Legend has it that no one can cross
the Moonriver 2 times alive.

334
01:21:57,172 --> 01:22:02,166
The body in the Moonriver
will be yours.

335
01:25:16,938 --> 01:25:21,841
What a shame. I'm going to cross
the river 2 times. Alive.

336
01:26:04,886 --> 01:26:10,153
This beautiful teacher is 
part of the Kanto Ashura Group.

337
01:26:10,291 --> 01:26:15,695
Junk Ashura, the fifth great leader.
- You already knew.

338
01:26:18,333 --> 01:26:24,169
You came to kill me
in order to stop the bloodshed.

339
01:26:26,274 --> 01:26:31,075
Every man is like his brother,
that also holds true for you.

340
01:26:33,014 --> 01:26:39,351
I know you're the only woman
he ever loved.

341
01:26:42,557 --> 01:26:45,993
I've started to think more like you.

342
01:26:46,127 --> 01:26:53,124
The old Yakuza who killed
your brother make me sick.

343
01:26:55,003 --> 01:26:58,837
That's why we started the
fireworks this time.

344
01:27:02,143 --> 01:27:06,170
The Fudoh-family
will leave for the mainland.

345
01:27:08,750 --> 01:27:12,652
Do you want to be our navigator
on the mainland?

346
01:27:33,708 --> 01:27:39,340
But first I have to take
care of something else.

347
01:29:57,018 --> 01:29:58,485
Father...

348
01:31:34,181 --> 01:31:36,911
Riki...

349
01:31:37,051 --> 01:31:38,951
You...

350
01:31:43,190 --> 01:31:46,284
Old man...

351
01:31:46,427 --> 01:31:50,625
The times when a child sacrificed itself
for his parents, are long gone.

352
01:31:55,069 --> 01:31:57,594
Not yet.

353
01:31:57,738 --> 01:31:59,729
It's not over yet.

354
01:32:41,849 --> 01:32:43,339
Old man...

355
01:33:16,651 --> 01:33:18,209
Riki...

356
01:33:41,709 --> 01:33:43,301
Father...

357
01:33:45,613 --> 01:33:52,075
Can you see the blue wind blow
and move the big forest?

358
01:34:37,698 --> 01:34:39,290
What are you doing here?

359
01:34:39,433 --> 01:34:43,335
You've come for young Fudoh's balls?
Now that's arrogant.

360
01:34:43,471 --> 01:34:48,238
You're mad.
- Hey, Nohma.

361
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:55,906
Shoot me if you want.

362
01:34:56,050 --> 01:34:59,679
You don't really look
like a hero...

363
01:34:59,820 --> 01:35:03,517
if you shoot an unarmed man
on a funeral.

364
01:35:03,657 --> 01:35:06,490
What did you say?
- Stop.

365
01:35:13,801 --> 01:35:16,634
Stop it.
Treat our guest...

366
01:35:20,474 --> 01:35:23,568
with the proper respect.

367
01:35:52,606 --> 01:35:58,806
Is this, besides your father's funeral,
also your first party as the new boss?

368
01:36:02,449 --> 01:36:05,316
Mr. Nohma...

369
01:36:05,452 --> 01:36:07,818
you're next.

370
01:36:19,166 --> 01:36:22,624
The party...

371
01:36:22,770 --> 01:36:25,330
has just begun.
