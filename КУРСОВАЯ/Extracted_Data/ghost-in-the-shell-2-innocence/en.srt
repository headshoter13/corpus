Eye in the Sky 202 to Control.
Now on station above scene.

0
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,280
Opening data link.

0
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,950
Sit-rep?

0
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:49,660
52 minutes ago the suspect killed its
owner at his condo the first crime scene

0
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,790
...and fled the area.

0
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,880
Suspect is now holed up in the second
crime scene an unmarked alleyway

0
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,710
where it's killed
two officers.

0
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,010
All entrances have been blocked.
In two minutes we plan to go in.

0
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,350
That's a Section 9 cyborg.

0
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:11,060
When those guys cross your path
you're in for a world of trouble.

0
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,560
Sounds like the Cyber Police
are itching to step in.

0
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,560
They're requesting
a data link.

0
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,530
First Public Security
and now the Cybercops huh?

0
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,360
Politely ask them
to take a hike.

0
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:58,830
Please help us...

0
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:47,130
The moon fails to shine down on either day or night

0
00:05:47,380 --> 00:06:10,780
and the night bird calls out in sadness.

0
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:31,300
When I turn to look

0
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:38,180
the flowers had all fallen away.

0
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:52,450
It was as if all comfort...

0
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:59,910
...had vanished from the world.

0
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:14,470
As the gods leave...

0
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:27,270
...to gather in the new world

0
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:47,170
day breaks and the night bird calls out.

0
00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:16,530
The blossoms beseech the gods.

0
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:27,330
"Even though in this world..."

0
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:36,680
"...we may know grief and suffering"

0
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:41,720
"our dreams shall never die"

0
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:56,150
...and they fall from the branch in anger.

0
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:09,040
There have already been eight homicides
committed by gynoids this week.

0
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,800
In each case they self-terminated
after killing their owners

0
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,710
and their cyberbrains
were reformatted.

0
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,630
The units were all made by
the Locus Solus company

0
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,010
...the type 2052
"Hadaly."

0
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,680
They're preliminary betas
of a mass-production model.

0
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,930
Apparently they were provided for free
to the company's contracted evaluators

0
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,140
but all of the units have
now been recalled.

0
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:30,560
According to the latest report they
submitted to the authorities

0
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:34,900
no bugs had been detected in either
their hardware or software.

0
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,370
You were paying attention
I hope.

0
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:53,380
A new line of gynoids went berserk for
reasons unknown and killed their owners.

0
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,920
The manufacturer recalled them
in a panic.

0
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:59,220
Next will come the usual lawsuits from the
next of kin and then protracted civil trials...

0
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,300
...centering around producer responsibility
to be followed by massive payouts.

0
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,930
I'd say I understand the gist of it except
for why Section 9 is getting involved.

0
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,100
You understand
do you?

0
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,770
More often than not what we call
understanding is based on wishful thinking.

0
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,940
At this time there are two reasons
for Section 9 to get involved.

0
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,990
The first is that no suits have
been filed by the next of kin.

0
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,910
All the cases have been settled in-house
at the manufacturer Locus Solus.

0
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:30,000
And the second is that among
the victims is a politician

0
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,630
as well as a retired
Public Security official.

0
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,880
It's possible that this might be
an act of terrorism

0
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,470
so determining if we ought to take lead
on the case also falls under our purview.

0
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,680
Ishikawa and Azuma you run down
leads on the victims.

0
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,180
You two check out the
gynoids in question.

0
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,850
No questions.
Get going.

0
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:05,620
Just so we're straight on this I didn't
ask to be partnered with you.

0
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:11,160
I'll be the first to admit that I
might not measure up to the Major.

0
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,120
That's not it.

0
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,670
I hear she's still
listed as missing.

0
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:27,180
The only things she really owned
were her brain and her Ghost.

0
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:31,180
Of course she herself wasn't too sure
she had even those.

0
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,480
Her prosthetic body and cyberbrain were
just government-issued equipment

0
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,230
and the memories inside that cyberbrain
were government property

0
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,030
top-secret intel
and all.

0
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,610
What the top brass want to get back
is those memories.

0
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,490
They couldn't care less
if she's alive or dead.

0
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,040
So how do you want
to start on this?

0
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,880
Well Locus Solus is a Northern Frontier
manufacturer located way up north.

0
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:59,090
Let's start with the basics and pay
the local cops' crime lab a visit.

0
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:05,050
{\an8}"Police"

0
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,080
You huh?

0
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,830
We're here about that doll the
Big Man here smashed up the other day.

0
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,420
That thing killed two
of our guys.

0
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,210
You don't expect to walk out
of here with it do you?

0
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:45,760
Part of our investigation is
to make that determination.

0
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:53,310
Forensics is on the 19th floor
end of the hall on the right.

0
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,020
Do I need to
show you the way?

0
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,190
No thanks. We didn't
come here for a tour.

0
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,860
"Not even crows will peck at a
persimmon that is still green."

0
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,320
But you can be sure they'll be circling
overhead when they're ripe.

0
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,340
Back when you were a cop wouldn't
you have had a few choice words...

0
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:32,060
...for somebody who swooped in out of
the blue and swiped a case from you?

0
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:36,680
That's what pissed me off. It's like
I was looking at the old me.

0
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:42,150
"Don't find fault with the mirror when
it's your own face that's distorted."

0
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,360
"The mirror is not a tool for realizing
the truth but rather for obscuring it" huh?

0
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:51,740
Hell neither one of you has a face
that I'd wanna see in the mirror.

0
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:38,000
If I told you once I told you a thousand
times. I'm not doing a joint examination.

0
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:40,500
Keep pestering me and I'll
have you taken into custody.

0
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:46,250
I'm Togusa Public Security Section 9.
My scary-looking friend here is...

0
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,670
The one who filled this poor girl
with double-aught buck I take it.

0
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:54,350
If you'd have used
.50-caliber hollowpoints

0
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,760
it would've been a simple
matter to restore it.

0
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:04,110
It killed three people.
And two of those were cops.

0
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:08,650
Before she was shot she tried
to commit suicide. Didn't she?

0
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,130
What do you mean
by "suicide" um...

0
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,340
Haraway.

0
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:34,680
Miss er Haraway what do you mean
by a robot committing suicide?

0
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,930
The gynoids give themselves authorization
to attack humans...

0
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,890
...by deliberately
malfunctioning.

0
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,100
But as a logical consequence
of those malfunctions

0
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,980
they're also freeing themselves
from Ethics Code article three.

0
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:51,860
"Protect your own existence so long as such
protection does not harm a human being."

0
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,990
I think it would be more accurate to
call it "self-termination" personally...

0
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:03,120
Yes if you assume that there is a clear
distinction between man and machine.

0
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,210
Is this "suicide" phenomenon
limited to a particular model?

0
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,800
I wish I could say it is
but no.

0
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,420
These past few years we've been seeing
a spike in robot-related incidents.

0
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:16,470
It's especially bad
in the "pet" models.

0
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,350
Any idea as to
the cause?

0
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:23,310
Who knows? Cyberbrain corruption
caused by a virus or microorganism?

0
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,770
Human error during the
manufacturing process?

0
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,690
Degraded functionality due to
age-related deterioration?

0
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,190
Take your pick.
Personally though...

0
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,690
What?

0
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:35,410
If you ask me I think it's because
humans discard their robots.

0
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:37,370
You know when they don't
want them anymore.

0
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:40,410
When the new models come out
people buy the latest and greatest

0
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,000
some of the discarded ones
end up on the streets

0
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,500
...where they gradually deteriorate
from lack of maintenance.

0
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,210
The robots just want us to stop
treating them as disposable.

0
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,470
Oh come on...

0
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,930
Humans and robots
are different.

0
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,850
But that sort of faith is nothing more than
the recognition that humans aren't robots

0
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,190
which is on the same level as
saying that white is not black.

0
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:16,570
Unlike things like industrial robots
pet androids and gynoids...

0
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:20,240
...weren't designed with utilitarianism
and pragmatism in mind.

0
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:25,500
Why did we feel the need to
create them in man's image?

0
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:28,830
In an idealized image
at that.

0
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,760
Why does humanity go to such lengths
to create these reflections of itself?

0
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,150
Do you have children?

0
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,150
Yes a daughter.

0
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,030
Children have always deviated
from the human norm.

0
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,200
That is if we define a human as something
that has a fixed identity...

0
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,910
...and acts in accordance
to its own free will.

0
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:08,330
What then are children those early-stage
humans who exist in a state of chaos?

0
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:13,170
Internally they clearly differ from humanity
yet they have the shape of humans.

0
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,050
The dolls that little girls use
when they play "mommy"...

0
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:19,130
...aren't merely a surrogate for a child
or something to practice on.

0
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:24,220
Perhaps these girls aren't practicing
raising children.

0
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:29,020
Rather perhaps playing with dolls
is much the same as raising children.

0
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,020
What in the world are
you talking about?

0
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:36,530
In other words child rearing is the quickest
method of realizing that oldest of dreams

0
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:39,110
...the act of creating
an artificial human.

0
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,370
That's the way
I see it.

0
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,410
Children aren't...
They aren't dolls!

0
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:50,670
Descartes didn't differentiate between man
and machine organic and inorganic life.

0
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,130
There was a doll that looked just like his
daughter Francine who died at age five.

0
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:56,880
He named it after her
and lavished it with love.

0
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,720
I almost forgot
about that...

0
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:05,050
Look can we get back to
the real-world matter at hand?

0
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,560
I'd like to hear your initial opinions
on that robot.

0
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,480
Locus Solus'
type 2052 "Hadaly."

0
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,360
True.

0
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,190
It's a fine piece
of work.

0
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,860
I'm told it's a beta-model mass-production
unit but it's built to unusual specs.

0
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,450
Unusual specs?

0
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,830
It's equipped with organs that aren't
exactly necessary on a maid-type model.

0
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,750
Meaning what
exactly?

0
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,790
It's a sexbot.

0
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:39,090
It's not a hobby you can brag about
to the public but it's not illegal.

0
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:43,010
Now I get it. It's no wonder that the
next of kin dropped the lawsuits.

0
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:46,510
As their cyberbrains shut down
they reformatted.

0
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:51,850
It's a standard practice to safeguard
the control software's technical data.

0
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,350
However...

0
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,730
"However" what?

0
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:58,230
There was a file left in the audio buffer.
Shall I play it?

0
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:18,840
Please help us...

0
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,170
Please help...

0
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,770
Thanks for
all your help.

0
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:33,640
Hey!

0
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:39,730
Um would you mind if I asked
a personal question?

0
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:44,950
I've never given birth to any children
and I haven't raised any.

0
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,240
I'm not registered
at the egg bank either.

0
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,530
Thank you for your time
Miss um...

0
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:54,710
Just "Haraway."
No Miss or Missus needed.

0
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,760
That lady wasn't your
typical engineer was she?

0
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:12,310
She's the type who fills out the
"personal comments" column in forms.

0
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,560
I used to do that
a lot too.

0
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,730
That's why you took so long
to climb the ranks.

0
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:19,650
Anyway I guess we should keep that
gynoid's cyberbrain at the Section 9 lab.

0
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:22,110
I guess we won't be talking
with that lady again huh?

0
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,650
She the type you like
to hang out with?

0
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:26,400
Yeah I have a thing for older women.
So what next?

0
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:27,990
We follow
the playbook.

0
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,490
Talk to the
shipping inspector huh?

0
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:33,620
09 calling 907. 602 in progress
at a boathouse in sector 201.

0
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,790
Victim is a shipping inspector
at Locus Solus.

0
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,920
Scene secured two minutes
prior to arrival of local police.

0
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,000
907 roger.

0
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:41,960
Goodness gracious
what a coincidence.

0
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,670
On every spring day between this world
and the next I spur on the coach.

0
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:03,190
What's up you're here
by yourself?

0
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,570
Yeah Koga went back to base
with the stiff...

0
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:08,490
...after getting reacquainted with the
tuna sandwich he had for dinner.

0
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,320
Geez that guy
is pathetic...

0
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,950
The crime scene as of
22 minutes ago.

0
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:27,340
You made a rookie
carry that back?

0
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,590
Hey everything's a
learning experience.

0
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,090
Okay here's a rundown
of the situation.

0
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,600
Match run on the
vic's cyberbrain.

0
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:38,680
Jacques Vaucanson Locus Solus
Chief Shipping Inspector. Age 54.

0
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,980
Submitted vacation request five days ago
then dropped off the radar.

0
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,110
Three days ago signed a rental
agreement for this houseboat...

0
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,570
...with a planned stay
of five days.

0
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:50,320
Murder weapons were kitchen implements
that came with the boat.

0
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:54,870
Search run on vehicles in the area.
Record of parked criminal vehicle located.

0
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:58,580
Check for yakuza affiliation
in progress.

0
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:05,250
Seven cards of various types found in
overcoat believed to belong to victim.

0
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,840
Check for usage
in progress.

0
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:31,070
Oopsie daisy. Got ourselves a
.38-caliber Smith & Wesson here.

0
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,110
Model 2602.

0
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:36,740
Looks like he didn't
have time to use it.

0
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,200
That might not have
done him any good.

0
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:45,130
An illegally amped-up cyborg.
Or a pro pretending to be a psycho.

0
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:49,420
969 calling 906.
Crime scene ETA 20 seconds.

0
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,720
- Hey don't mess up my...
- We're not touching anything.

0
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:55,970
Let's let Forensics
take it from here.

0
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,930
907 to 09. Relinquishing
crime scene to 969.

0
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,270
09 acknowledged.

0
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,270
Today's my
daughter's birthday.

0
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,980
A family man huh?

0
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,280
I'll drop you off.

0
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,200
I'm in the opposite direction.
Ishikawa?

0
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,860
I'm the
other way too.

0
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:17,780
They say a daughter's birthday
takes priority over everything else.

0
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:19,950
Looks like you guys are
having a grand old time.

0
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,410
Coming out in person huh?
That's a rare sight.

0
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,920
Our stiff was missing some parts
so I decided to get involved.

0
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,420
We'll get outta your hair
so take your time looking for 'em.

0
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,340
Why aren't you letting the
local cops handle this?

0
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,010
The Old Man's got his knickers
in a twist over it for some reason.

0
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:35,760
Found them! They're sitting
in jars in the refrigerator!

0
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:39,600
Heart. Liver. Kidneys.
The pancreas too.

0
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,770
This is one
tidy SOB...

0
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,780
Inumaru Foods'
wet dog food huh?

0
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:01,120
If you bought dry food
it'd keep for six months.

0
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,500
I can't feed her
that garbage.

0
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:11,920
So I hear you're teamed up
with Togusa.

0
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:15,970
Better him than some rookie
fresh out of the academy.

0
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:20,180
He's competent enough for a former
detective. I've got no complaints.

0
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,890
'Cause the only person
you ever partnered with...

0
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:25,230
...who you thought made the grade
was the Major.

0
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,690
- Look...
- Ishikawa.

0
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:33,570
I liked you better when
you were the silent type.

0
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:01,760
Later.

0
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:02,970
Batou.

0
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,270
Yeah what?

0
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:06,930
Take my advice.
Switch to the dry.

0
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:11,520
Just from a nutritional balance
perspective it's the smart choice.

0
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:03,300
Cause of death was crushing of the
cervical vertebrae by blunt force trauma.

0
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:06,220
We determined that the kitchen tools
weren't the murder weapon

0
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,630
but were instead used to
mutilate the corpse.

0
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:11,510
So you're saying that they killed the guy
then leisurely dismantled him?

0
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,140
Yeah that's what it
boils down to.

0
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,310
We confirmed that the organs stored in
the refrigerator belonged to the victim.

0
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,480
They showed early signs of gastritis
and cirrhosis of the liver.

0
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,230
Looks like he had
a drinking problem.

0
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,820
Why'd he gut the guy
so meticulously?

0
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,690
Maybe to make us think he was
mentally unstable or a sicko?

0
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,110
Or to reinforce a message
of punishment or revenge.

0
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,200
Which would nix the "pro hit
disguised as a thrill kill" theory.

0
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,160
What's the story with
the mangled doorknob?

0
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:42,540
Analysis identified the prosthetic limb
as a Chinese-made NR26.

0
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:44,210
A Crab Claw huh?

0
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,210
Isn't that military?

0
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,010
They're available on the black market.
A lot of 'em are defective though.

0
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:51,550
It was also a match to the lacerations
on the corpse's head.

0
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:55,310
What about the owner of that car
the one with criminal history?

0
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:58,310
Looks like there were a lot of illegal mods
so tracking it down wasn't...

0
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,390
Just report
your findings.

0
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,820
According to my follow-up investigation on
the records of the neighboring parking lot

0
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,150
the car belongs to the Koujinkai
a designated violent criminal organization.

0
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:11,700
It's been bulletproofed and the chassis
and rear shocks have been beefed up.

0
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,950
It's been spotted at the scenes of multiple
violent crimes in the past.

0
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,870
Tricked-out wheels for
a tricked-out cyborg.

0
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,500
Yeah for hired muscle with
illegally amped output.

0
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,120
Are we looking at some kind
of yakuza payback here?

0
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:23,920
The problem is motive.
What do we have on the Koujinkai?

0
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:26,550
They're a Japanese mob group
that goes way back.

0
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:29,010
Drugs prostitution human trafficking
Real estate extortion.

0
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:30,880
They've got a finger
in just about every pie.

0
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,510
A Hadaly ripped their boss Inoue's
head off three days ago.

0
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,720
His deputy Wakabayashi is now
running things in his place.

0
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:38,930
Come on it's obvious.

0
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:42,100
Yeah avenging the previous boss
is a prerequisite for taking over.

0
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:46,980
There's just one problem with that.
If our vic was expecting retaliation

0
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:50,570
why would he choose a place to lie low
that was inside Koujinkai territory?

0
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:55,200
His cyberbrain data's been wiped so I
guess we'll have to check out his associates.

0
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,330
In any case this is definitely
a job for the local cops.

0
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:01,250
And the possibility of it being a terrorist
act disguised as a robot runaway?

0
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:05,250
At this time we haven't found any
political factors that link all the victims.

0
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,210
That's looking
awfully unlikely.

0
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,920
Batou and Togusa will work full-time
on these Hadaly runaways

0
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:13,840
including this incident.

0
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:16,090
The rest of you return to
your regular shifts.

0
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,220
Dismissed.

0
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:20,890
Togusa.

0
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:26,400
Come see me
before you leave.

0
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,950
What do you think?

0
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:41,040
I guess we'll have to check into a link
between the Koujinkai and Locus Solus to...

0
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,120
I was talking about
Batou.

0
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:48,170
Partners are supposed to monitor
each other's mental state.

0
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:52,130
Even so I'm not a cyborg
and I'm certainly no cyber-physician.

0
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:55,930
"To understand Caesar
one need not be Caesar."

0
00:32:56,510 --> 00:33:01,140
You have a family as I recall.
Do you consider yourself happy?

0
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,640
Sure I guess...

0
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:06,810
A man once said that we are never so
happy or so unhappy as we suppose.

0
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:11,440
That what is important is to never grow
tired of your life and aspirations.

0
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,190
What are you
getting at sir?

0
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,110
When I look
at him lately

0
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,120
I'm reminded of the Major
just before she disappeared.

0
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,790
"Let a man walk alone
let him commit no sin"

0
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:29,710
"let him have few wishes
like an elephant in the forest."

0
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:43,640
Chief. Why did you
choose me for this?

0
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:47,850
Because it was the Major who
scouted you from the police force.

0
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,320
So what did he
have to say?

0
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,700
Apparently you don't have to
be Caesar to understand him.

0
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,370
That goes
without saying.

0
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:05,250
The world can't live up to standards
set by the giants of history.

0
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,760
You planning to start a war
or something?

0
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:19,180
One need not be a yakuza when
one goes to a yakuza office

0
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,760
but you do need to
pack some heat.

0
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:23,510
Look before we head out I want
to make sure of something.

0
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,430
Yeah what?

0
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:26,220
We're just going there
to talk right?

0
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:27,930
Do you hate yakuza?

0
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,270
Can't stand the bastards.

0
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:30,310
Same here.

0
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,150
We're going there to talk.
Just talk. Right?

0
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:35,030
Hey didn't I tell you that
to go to a yakuza office...

0
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:37,070
Yeah you don't have
to become a yakuza.

0
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:39,200
But you also said that
you needed weapons.

0
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,780
I have a family
got it?

0
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,280
I can go by myself
if you want.

0
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:44,700
I'm going with you.
That's what partners do.

0
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,290
So I want you to give me
your word.

0
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:49,830
We're just gonna talk. I'll avoid
shooting as much as possible.

0
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,630
- Happy now?
- Fine.

0
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:54,290
Then saddle up
partner.

0
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,190
Who the hell
are you two?

0
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:14,980
We need to talk with your
buddy Wakabayashi. Go get him.

0
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,080
You said you were gonna
avoid shooting.

0
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,500
I did avoid shooting.
As much as possible.

0
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,670
Get moving point man.
Reinforcements are on the way.

0
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:01,950
A hologram?

0
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:04,570
The son of a bitch
hacked our eyes?!

0
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:16,000
Blame those cheap-ass
cyberbrains of yours.

0
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:34,190
What's the holdup?

0
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,520
It's a dark narrow stairwell.
How do we handle this?

0
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:39,940
One at a time.
I'll go first.

0
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:44,150
I'll go first. You're so big that
I won't be able to cover you.

0
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:23,190
I set off your little presents
above our heads.

0
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:27,700
Even assuming they'd gone off in
their maximum effective radius

0
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:31,950
it'd take more than two of 'em to take out
a cyborg wearing body armor.

0
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,580
Are you trying
to insult me?

0
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:43,420
I don't just want to know about the hit
on the shipping inspector.

0
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:46,300
You're gonna tell me what your
connection is to Locus Solus too.

0
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,440
Was wondering when
you'd show up...

0
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:12,280
Come get some crab boy. I hate seafood
but I'm gonna chew you up.

0
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:45,360
Come on no way is a flashy move
like gonna connect! Dumbass.

0
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:04,500
He said he knew where the inspector
was so we dealt with him...

0
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:10,300
Look I just got out of the joint
after three years!

0
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:14,510
I don't know shit about what the old
boss was up to with that company!

0
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,390
You still breathing
partner?

0
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,190
My wife and daughter's faces
flashed before my eyes...

0
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,860
That wasn't your wife and daughter
you were looking at.

0
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:27,650
That was the angel of death
coming for you.

0
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:32,530
I ordered you to conduct
an investigation.

0
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:36,410
I don't recall telling you to cut corners
and take the law into your own hands

0
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:40,160
...and I certainly don't recall telling you
to launch an assault on a yakuza office!

0
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:45,090
This isn't the jungle and you two aren't
Special Forces wetwork specialists!

0
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,340
Still mad huh?

0
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:53,760
I'm not mad.
It's just well...

0
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:56,720
I don't want to sound ungrateful
to somebody who saved my life

0
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:05,110
...but it's pretty obvious that I'll need a few
extra lives if I'm gonna team up with you.

0
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,020
It's just you and me working
this case full-time.

0
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:10,860
Half-assed measures aren't
gonna get us anywhere.

0
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,030
If there's something shady going on
between them and Locus Solus

0
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,820
they'll definitely
take the bait.

0
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,910
That's why you did something
so over the top?

0
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:23,120
If the Old Man was really angry with us
we'd both be on desk duty right now.

0
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,290
Pull over up there.

0
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:45,150
See ya.

0
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,940
You've stepped inside
the kill zone.

0
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:41,360
Don't go screwing around with
the settings on that right arm.

0
00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:44,910
Updated drivers have been
known to conflict with...

0
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:48,290
...fire control software and
cause degraded functionality.

0
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,910
If it happens I'll come in
and get it reset.

0
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,420
Hey what do you think they did with
the remains of my original arm?

0
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:55,460
Don't bother.

0
00:43:55,590 --> 00:44:00,340
The organic components in that arm
have been matched to your DNA.

0
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:04,390
In other words it'll be as good as
my original once I break it in...

0
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,850
Ow! Wait a minute
damn it!

0
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:19,480
Hey if you're bringing her here
that means you...

0
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:22,110
Sorry we broke into your
little love nest.

0
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,320
The thought of her sitting there
howling for her missing master

0
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:28,330
starving and covered in her
own shit broke my heart.

0
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,950
I may look gruff but I've
got a soft spot for dogs.

0
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,210
Yeah but I was the one who
took her home for the night.

0
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:37,170
My daughter was ecstatic but my wife
is pissed about the mess on the carpet.

0
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:39,840
How long did you have us
under surveillance?

0
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,630
It's no big deal
don't sweat it.

0
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,760
Damn straight it is.
Using me as a smoke screen...

0
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,140
It's not my fault you were
too green to spot the tail.

0
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,850
If you're gonna hate anyone
hate the Old Man.

0
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:54,100
Is she a clone?
Originals cost a fortune right?

0
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:59,070
Apparently this was the first type of
dog bred by artificial insemination.

0
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,900
It's not like you to let somebody hack
into your cyberbrain like that.

0
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:06,320
When your daily routine falls into a pattern
that's when you're vulnerable to traps.

0
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:08,570
I told you to switch
to dry food idiot.

0
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:13,620
It's her favorite. That's the only store
around here where I can get it.

0
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:16,080
Somebody pulled your strings
to make you go berserk.

0
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,880
You ended up putting five rounds
into your own arm

0
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,920
and came this close to
blowing away the store owner.

0
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:27,010
You might be off your game but there aren't
many people capable of hacking you.

0
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,970
Other than the Major
that is.

0
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,310
Why didn't they make me blow
my brains out right off the bat?

0
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:38,690
Because their goal wasn't to eliminate you
it was to create a scandal.

0
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:43,860
You busted into a mob office and sent a
dozen people to the afterlife or the hospital.

0
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:49,120
And then before the day was out
you shot up a convenience store.

0
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:53,040
Anybody would think that you're nuts or
have one serious cyberbrain malfunction.

0
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,200
Hey wait a minute.

0
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:58,920
This attack proves that this case isn't
a simple accident. If we back off now...

0
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,420
"Then what's the point of there being
a Section 9 in the first place?"

0
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,960
If she were here I bet
that's what she'd say.

0
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:07,180
Message from the Old Man.
"Continue the investigation."

0
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:10,260
"But until you have material
evidence there can be..."

0
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:12,470
"...no official support
from this point forward."

0
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:15,930
Guess we'll have to go check out
Locus Solus in person.

0
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:20,440
"Speed is key when preserving secrecy.
Fly to the Northern Frontier ASAP" he says.

0
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,440
Up north?

0
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,820
You two aren't
up to it?

0
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:25,190
No it's just...
But what about the dog?

0
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:28,280
The issue here is a guy in this line
of work a bachelor at that

0
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,240
having a dog in
the first place!

0
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:34,120
Of all the dogs in the world you had
to pick a high-maintenance breed!

0
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:36,620
Come up with something
your own damn selves!

0
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:39,100
In its heyday this was the
Etorofu Special Economic Zone

0
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:43,150
built to be the greatest
information-intensive city in the Far East.

0
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:47,530
All that's left to show it was ever here
is this forest of giant grave markers.

0
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:50,440
Its iffy sovereignty status has
made it the perfect hangout...

0
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:55,070
...for multinationals and the criminal
organizations that feed on their scraps.

0
00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:59,870
A no-man's-land outside the reach of both
UN Net Police and ASEAN Cybercops.

0
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:03,540
Reminds me of that quote about how an
artifact that a single individual builds...

0
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:07,000
...is as much an expression of the builder's
genetic phenotype as the builder itself.

0
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:11,090
That guy was talking about
beaver dams and spider webs.

0
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:14,760
I'll take coralline algae and the
coral reefs they create thanks.

0
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,470
These are nowhere near
as pretty though.

0
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:22,850
If life's true nature is information
that's passed down via genes

0
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:26,440
then society and civilization are also nothing
more than gigantic memory systems

0
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,570
which makes cities huge
external memory devices.

0
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:32,570
"How precious also are thy thoughts unto
me O God! How great is the sum of them!"

0
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:36,780
"If I should count them they are
more in number than the sand."

0
00:48:37,370 --> 00:48:41,290
Psalm 139 from the
Old Testament huh?

0
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:44,080
The way it calls up quotes
like that at the drop of a hat

0
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:48,170
maybe your external memory's phenotype
has a bit of your philosophical bent.

0
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:50,630
Yeah like you're one
to talk.

0
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:54,720
Sorry to interrupt fellas but we'll be over
the Locus Solus head office building soon.

0
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:57,970
I'll do a slow flyby for you guys so
hold on tight and enjoy the scenery.

0
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,480
All right that's all for our little side tour.
Now coming in to land.

0
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,940
"Angel Forms who lay intrans't
Thick as Autumnal Leaves."

0
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:54,400
"Nine dayes they fell;
confounded Chaos roard."

0
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:59,320
Quoting Milton this time?
I got news for you we aren't Satan.

0
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:57,010
The night bird calls out in sadness.

0
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:11,020
When I turn to look

0
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:18,320
the flowers had all fallen away.

0
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:32,080
It was as if all comfort...

0
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:39,720
...had vanished from the world.

0
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:53,980
As the gods leave...

0
00:51:54,190 --> 00:52:06,660
...to gather in the new world

0
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:26,260
day breaks and the night bird calls out.

0
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:55,500
The blossoms beseech the gods.

0
00:52:55,830 --> 00:53:06,220
"Even though in this world..."

0
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:15,730
"...we may know grief and suffering"

0
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:25,070
"our dreams shall never die"...

0
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:53,350
B-Batou!

0
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:03,730
Oh you're a real bigshot now. When did you
grow the stones to drop the "sir" with me?

0
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:06,360
I haven't forgotten
the debt I owe you!

0
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:09,570
"I never recall you to my memory
because I have never forgotten you" huh?

0
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:11,830
C'mon cut me
some slack Batou! Sir.

0
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:14,540
But I also have too much dignity to be
buttered up by you calling me "sir."

0
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:17,620
Forgive me! I beg you!
I'll be in your debt for life!

0
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:19,500
You know a guy by
the name of Kim?

0
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:20,920
Never heard
of him.

0
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,010
I mean guys with that name
are a dime a dozen around here.

0
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:27,680
Maybe but I'm only looking
for one Kim in particular.

0
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,050
Hey there's such a thing as
loyalty in my line of work.

0
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:34,270
"There are two kinds of loyalty. One
maintains secrets the other openness."

0
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:37,730
"The two cannot coexist."
Which kind do you have?

0
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:40,440
The same guy also said that without lies
there can be no truth!

0
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:43,230
I'll ask you one more time. You know
this guy named Kim don't you?

0
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:46,650
I don't know the guy!
Uh I don't know that particular Kim!

0
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:52,450
"When we face death our life
is like a puppet on a festival cart."

0
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:56,620
"As soon as one string is cut
it crumples and fades."

0
00:55:03,590 --> 00:55:13,850
"Even though
in this world..."

0
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:23,230
"...we may know grief
and suffering"

0
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:28,570
"our dreams
shall never die"...

0
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:37,620
...and they fall from the branch
in anger.

00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:00,640
Well?

0
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:03,440
He started out as a long-range scout
for the military.

0
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:07,320
"Having failed in leading
having failed in following"

0
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,900
"...he is fit only to die
by the side of the road."

0
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,860
His career was shot to hell for things
like running black market arms deals...

0
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:17,240
...while he was bouncing between
Special Forces and cyberwarfare units.

0
00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:21,370
In the end he wound up
your stereotypical hacker.

0
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,500
One of those "colorful history"
types huh?

0
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:29,210
"If an ass goes a-traveling
he'll not come back a horse."

0
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:33,180
He's just a dumb son of a bitch who
bit off more than he could chew.

0
00:56:34,050 --> 00:56:35,640
You coming?

0
00:59:26,350 --> 00:59:28,980
Batou. In the study
on the upper floor.

0
00:59:47,290 --> 00:59:49,040
I guess we got here
too late.

0
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:53,210
He must've tried to hack into somewhere
and gotten fried by an attack barrier.

0
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:57,210
He probably wouldn't have been any
use to us even if he was still alive.

0
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:06,720
"In accordance with the deceased's wishes
we firmly decline..."

0
01:00:06,850 --> 01:00:10,390
"...any offers of live flowers artificial flowers
or releasing of birds."

0
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,440
Hey!

0
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:19,860
"In bed he did not lie
like a corpse."

0
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:23,700
Even the great Confucius says
you shouldn't play possum.

0
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:27,280
I haven't got time to play
your stupid games.

0
01:00:48,430 --> 01:00:52,060
It's been a long time Batou. Not since
the Nemuro landing operation.

0
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:53,890
I'm here
on business.

0
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:58,320
Locus Solus huh? They got into robot
manufacturing late in the game

0
01:00:58,610 --> 01:01:01,900
but once they switched focus to developing
and producing high-end gynoids

0
01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:03,820
their business started
to expand rapidly.

0
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,240
It's rumored that they're cozy
with politicians

0
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:09,370
high-ranking bureaucrats
and even organized crime.

0
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:17,130
They got paranoid about visits from
the authorities so they set up...

0
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:21,590
...their production line inside a multinational
factory ship anchored off the coast.

0
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:25,800
The dolls they make there
are fine pieces of work.

0
01:01:26,970 --> 01:01:30,510
Good enough to commit murder
and then kill themselves?

0
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:33,890
If that's true
it's pretty disturbing.

0
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:50,370
I don't understand people
who try to mimic humans...

0
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:52,040
...by breathing souls
into dolls.

0
01:01:52,330 --> 01:01:57,790
The definition of a truly beautiful doll is
a flesh and blood body devoid of a soul.

0
01:01:58,670 --> 01:02:04,210
A corpse standing on tiptoes
teetering on the brink of collapse.

0
01:02:05,010 --> 01:02:09,260
And that's why you decided to turn
yourself into a cyberized invalid?

0
01:02:09,390 --> 01:02:12,310
In terms of appearance
and grace of movement

0
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:16,270
no in their very existence
humans don't hold a candle to dolls.

0
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:22,610
The flaws in man's knowledge
leads to flaws in man's reality.

0
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:25,820
That sort of perfection can only
be achieved by something...

0
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:29,950
...that possesses no consciousness
or possesses infinite consciousness.

0
01:02:30,030 --> 01:02:34,240
In other words
only by dolls or gods.

0
01:02:34,370 --> 01:02:37,210
Look would you mind getting down
to the business at hand?

0
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:43,210
Actually there is one other being
that is on par with dolls or gods.

0
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,590
Animals huh?

0
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:49,720
Shelly's skylarks are filled with the joy
of the deep subconscious

0
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:56,220
something that creatures like us with our
strong sense of self can never experience.

0
01:02:57,270 --> 01:03:00,770
For the descendants of those who ate
of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge

0
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:04,230
that's a far more difficult proposition
than becoming as gods.

0
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:10,450
So you put yourself into the body of
a doll and played dead. Is that why?

0
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:16,410
As Confucius said "Not yet understanding
life how can you understand death?"

0
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:20,290
"Few people know death..."

0
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:34,600
"...we only endure it"

0
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:37,310
"usually from determination
and even from stupidity and custom;"

0
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:42,020
"and most men only die because
they know not how to prevent dying."

0
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:46,150
But to a living doll
death is a given a fact of life.

0
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:51,320
That was the reason Kim decided
to get a full prosthetic body.

0
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:52,660
Well?

0
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:56,660
His career was shot to hell for things
like running black market arms deals...

0
01:03:57,080 --> 01:04:00,830
...while he was bouncing between
Special Forces and cyberwarfare units.

0
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:03,790
In the end he wound up
your stereotypical hacker.

0
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,790
One of those "colorful history"
types huh?

0
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:10,970
"If an ass goes a-traveling
he'll not come back a... horse."

0
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:14,930
What's the matter?
Let's go.

0
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,170
Batou!

0
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:50,480
"On this day of this month the deceased
wishes to inform the public..."

0
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:53,320
"...of the happy occasion
of his death."

0
01:05:59,660 --> 01:06:00,740
Hey!

0
01:06:16,970 --> 01:06:21,470
This is seriously disturbing isn't it?
Trust me I know how you feel.

0
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:35,860
It's the uncertainty that maybe something
that appears to be alive actually isn't.

0
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,660
And the uncertainty that
on the other hand

0
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:41,700
maybe something that doesn't appear
to be alive actually is.

0
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:45,830
If you want to know what
makes dolls so unnerving

0
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:49,370
it's because they are
modelled after humans.

0
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:53,170
In other words it is because they
are no less than humanity itself.

0
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:59,630
The fear that humans might be reduced
to simple mechanisms and materials.

0
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:03,180
The fear in other words
that the human phenomenon...

0
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:07,600
...is fundamentally devoid
of meaning and purpose.

0
01:07:08,390 --> 01:07:11,100
Stop this crap and let's
get down to business.

0
01:07:11,690 --> 01:07:15,150
Even science which has tried to shed
light on the phenomenon of life

0
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:18,450
has played a major role
in fomenting this fear.

0
01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:22,950
The belief that nature is quantifiable
leads to the conclusion...

0
01:07:23,030 --> 01:07:27,290
...that humanity can also be reduced
to simple mechanical parts.

0
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:30,960
"The human body is a machine
which winds its own springs."

0
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:33,590
"It is the living image
of perpetual movement."

0
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:36,840
The 18th Century
"man as machine" theory...

0
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:40,680
...has been resurrected by cyberbrains
and prosthetic body technology.

0
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:44,970
Ever since it became possible to externalize
memory through the use of computers

0
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:47,770
man has been aggressively
mechanizing himself...

0
01:07:47,850 --> 01:07:52,560
...in order to expand the upper limits
of his abilities as a living creature.

0
01:07:53,270 --> 01:07:57,280
It's a manifestation of the desire to
overcome Darwinian survival of the fittest

0
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:01,320
and to break free of the evolutionary
rat race through sheer strength of will

0
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:06,120
as well as the desire to outdo the natural
world that gave birth to humanity itself.

0
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:12,040
The fantasy of a lifeform equipped
with perfect hardware...

0
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:14,540
...is what gave rise
to this nightmare.

0
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:18,590
"God forever geometrizes."

0
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:27,430
Let's go!

0
01:08:45,070 --> 01:08:46,320
Batou!

0
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,060
How do you feel?

0
01:09:52,770 --> 01:09:54,390
I... What the hell?

0
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:58,350
You were in a virtual experience maze.
Your cyberbrain got hacked.

0
01:09:59,190 --> 01:10:01,270
Just like good things
come in threes

0
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:04,150
bad things also turn up
in sets of three.

0
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:06,700
You don't want to see so you don't look.
And even if you notice you say nothing.

0
01:10:06,820 --> 01:10:09,780
And if you say something no one listens.
Then catastrophe comes calling.

0
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:12,410
But in our world we don't
get three chances.

0
01:10:12,580 --> 01:10:15,000
If we miss that first hint
it's all over.

0
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:19,330
I thought I told you that we didn't
have time for your games.

0
01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:22,750
When did you
figure it out?!

0
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:26,630
Nobody's easier to trick than somebody
who thinks he's tricking you.

0
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,890
You might have been
a cyberwarfare specialist

0
01:10:29,970 --> 01:10:32,350
...but I'm an old
infowar pro myself.

0
01:10:32,430 --> 01:10:35,770
And besides I have a guardian angel
looking over my shoulder.

0
01:10:35,890 --> 01:10:40,980
Call up the hall data from that huge
external memory device of yours.

0
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:52,910
According to Jacob Grimm a golem
an artificial human was given energy...

0
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:57,830
...by inscribing the word "aemaeth"
meaning "truth" on its forehead.

0
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:01,080
But if you erase the first two letters
"ae" it becomes "meath"

0
01:11:01,210 --> 01:11:04,380
meaning "death" and it turns
back to lifeless clay.

0
01:11:04,710 --> 01:11:07,590
This was an oracle telling me that there
was no truth to be found here in this villa.

0
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:10,760
You're trying to tell me that someone
breached the barriers I set up?

0
01:11:10,930 --> 01:11:13,050
Impossible! No one could
pull that off!

0
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:16,640
Weren't you listening?
I said I have a guardian angel.

0
01:11:17,810 --> 01:11:21,190
Game's over Kim.
You're going to tell us everything.

0
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:30,410
That's an ordinary doll.

0
01:11:32,370 --> 01:11:36,330
You need to learn when to quit Kim.
You think I'd fall for a stunt like that?

0
01:11:36,450 --> 01:11:40,210
Batou can you say for sure
that this isn't just a continuation...

0
01:11:40,290 --> 01:11:43,790
...of the reality that was manufactured
by my virtual signals?

0
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:48,010
My Ghost is whispering
to me.

0
01:11:48,090 --> 01:11:52,090
Humanity is just another thread
from which the dream of life is woven.

0
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:55,430
That is if our dreams intelligence
and yes even our Ghosts

0
01:11:55,720 --> 01:12:00,180
are rips and distortions that arise
in the uniform timeless matrix.

0
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:03,980
You and I are both
worthless human beings

0
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:06,360
but we're not in
the same shoes.

0
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:08,690
Folks who doesn't believe
in the Ghost...

0
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:12,860
...will never know madness schizophrenia
or a million other little things.

0
01:12:12,950 --> 01:12:16,490
What little flesh you have left
will never decay.

0
01:12:16,790 --> 01:12:21,830
I bet it'll keep on functioning physically
until you finally get what's coming to you.

0
01:12:41,810 --> 01:12:45,060
We're really back in the
real world right?

0
01:12:45,150 --> 01:12:48,690
There's nothing to distinguish between
a memory and your recollection of it.

0
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:55,570
In both cases any understanding of its
significance only comes after the fact.

0
01:12:56,530 --> 01:12:59,240
Not being able to save the subjective
passage of time makes things tricky.

0
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:02,580
When you have a cyberbrain and allow
your memories to be shared externally

0
01:13:02,710 --> 01:13:04,420
this is one price you're
gonna pay sooner or later.

0
01:13:05,330 --> 01:13:09,210
Do you have really have a wife and kid
waiting for you at home?

0
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:12,050
Or are you still
a bachelor

0
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:15,510
sitting alone in some dingy apartment
somewhere dreaming you have a family?

0
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:19,310
Don't you want
to go find out?

0
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:21,770
If you he was gonna try that
why didn't you stop him?!

0
01:13:21,890 --> 01:13:24,640
I had to find out what
his objective was.

0
01:13:25,270 --> 01:13:27,770
He set his trap knowing
I'd come to him for help

0
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:30,820
then infect us with that virtual
experience to get rid of us.

0
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,440
Probably something
like that.

0
01:13:32,570 --> 01:13:35,360
Maybe he planted a tap in my cyberbrain
when he had me dancing to his tune...

0
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:38,240
...and made me blow off
my right arm.

0
01:13:38,870 --> 01:13:41,870
Just like Ishikawa said
somebody who could pull that off...

0
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:43,870
...wouldn't stop
at just that.

0
01:13:44,210 --> 01:13:46,920
Locus Solus is probably
thinking the same thing.

0
01:13:47,210 --> 01:13:49,710
So you anticipated this would happen
from the very beginning?

0
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:53,760
The plan was to make him think I'd fallen
into his trap to get close to him

0
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,260
but Kim is one talented
son of a bitch.

0
01:13:56,430 --> 01:13:58,890
If I hadn't gotten that sign
I never would have made it out.

0
01:13:58,970 --> 01:14:02,220
That "guardian angel"
you mentioned it isn't...

0
01:14:02,850 --> 01:14:08,690
She's gone away. Out beyond
the rips in the uniform matrix.

0
01:14:09,690 --> 01:14:14,650
Somewhere out in the vast net
she's fused with the entire realm.

0
01:14:16,570 --> 01:14:19,070
If you're looking to prove
your own existence

0
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:21,990
there's as many ways
as there are Ghosts.

0
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:24,580
You yourself have
a daughter remember?

0
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:29,000
Back when we were in the jungle even that
bastard Kim must have understood that.

0
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:32,250
I've come out of this with
a valuable lesson too.

0
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:33,130
What's that?

0
01:14:33,170 --> 01:14:36,300
That I don't have what it takes
to be your partner.

0
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:38,340
You wimping out
on me?

0
01:14:38,470 --> 01:14:40,090
It's not because
of what you said

0
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:42,930
but I do want to make it back
to my daughter in one piece.

0
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:46,230
Be that as it may I'm still gonna
make you earn your paycheck.

0
01:14:46,310 --> 01:14:47,600
You're not done yet?

0
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:51,360
The files we pulled from his cyberbrain
prove Locus Solus' criminal...

0
01:14:51,860 --> 01:14:56,320
All we can prove is obstruction
and violating the Cyberbrain Ethics Act.

0
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:59,110
And besides our investigation
is off the books.

0
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:04,160
To prove criminal liability in the killing
rampage those gynoids went on

0
01:15:04,290 --> 01:15:06,080
we need hard evidence
remember?

0
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:08,500
Maybe but Kim's
a dead end.

0
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:09,750
No he isn't.

0
01:15:09,830 --> 01:15:13,840
His cyberbrain is Ghost-packed
but it's still linked to Locus Solus.

0
01:15:14,130 --> 01:15:16,710
We have to finish this before they
say to hell with appearances...

0
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,670
...and tie up all their
loose ends.

0
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:21,590
Long ago people had
a great expression.

0
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:25,310
"When right and wrong are in doubt
beat the drums and attack."

0
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,180
When talk has failed
it's time for violence.

0
01:15:28,310 --> 01:15:32,730
Hey! This is worlds apart from
busting into some yakuza office!

0
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:36,030
I'm not counting on your
Mateba to watch my back.

0
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:42,410
"Birds hide by flying high into the heavens
and fish by diving deep into the sea..."

0
01:16:21,150 --> 01:16:23,740
- Contact made with escort.
- Roger.

0
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:26,910
I'm amazed you have the guts
to dive with a body like that.

0
01:16:26,990 --> 01:16:30,540
This area's so deep that if you went down
not even we could retrieve you.

0
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:34,210
I used to know a cyborg who
went scuba diving for fun.

0
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:34,920
Yeah?

0
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,750
I don't know what the hell
she was thinking.

0
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:39,670
I'm playing along because
Lin vouched for you

0
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:42,930
but they say that nobody's ever gone
to that ship and lived to tell about it.

0
01:16:43,050 --> 01:16:44,590
I don't know what
you are thinking.

0
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:46,430
That makes two of us.
Take us in.

0
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,470
Hold on tight.

0
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:09,200
Contact with sensor picket line
in 12 seconds.

0
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:12,120
I'm gonna send out a virtual signal
for 2 seconds on their channel.

0
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:13,330
Acknowledged.

0
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:17,080
I'll be this guy's wired directly to the
security supervisor's cyberbrain...

0
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,260
Commencing synchronization.

0
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,910
All right I'm in.
Send me the ship schematics.

0
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:36,750
Upload complete. Are you
piggybacking my visual feed?

0
01:18:36,830 --> 01:18:39,380
Of course. I wouldn't miss the
Big Man's big infiltration.

0
01:18:39,670 --> 01:18:40,840
I'm already recording.

0
01:18:41,130 --> 01:18:43,380
You can be a real smartass
you know that?

0
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:52,180
{\an8}"Please let the dawn..."

0
01:18:52,260 --> 01:19:04,900
{\an8}"...be waiting in the underworld."

0
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:25,460
Intruder alert. Reactivate
security system at level 2.

01:19:25,590 --> 01:19:28,590
Begin facility-wide scan
of all cyberbrain activity.

0
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:30,680
Scanning for terminals where memory
usage and virus size matches.

0
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:35,140
Possible time bomb virus.
Be advised.

0
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:37,770
Unable to establish logic connection

Deploying full array of ambush virus
variants inside barriers.

0
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:02,330
Commencing isolation
of infected areas.

0
01:20:02,710 --> 01:20:04,790
Rebuild peripheral barriers

0
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:06,630
Barrier 014 breached.

01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:08,090
Barrier 032

0
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:11,470

Commencing virus transfer.

01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:23,230
{\an8}"Please let the dawn..."

0
01:20:15,810 --> 01:20:19,310
Pull out! It's too dangerous for you to stay
any longer! You'll get your brain fried!

0
01:20:19,430 --> 01:20:21,390
Not yet! I can keep working
a little longer!

0
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:24,230
You dumb bastard!
Don't try to be a hero!

Illegal input in gynoid production line

Alert. Abnormal startup
of bodies on THO7 line.

0
01:22:04,790 --> 01:22:10,380
Security teams arm yourselves
and proceed to line at once.

0
01:22:10,420 --> 01:22:12,130
Repeating...

0
01:22:15,470 --> 01:22:38,610
{\an8}The blossoms beseech the gods.

"And the Holy Spirit descended

Been a long time
Major.

0
01:23:57,990 --> 01:23:59,950
Or what should I call you
these days?

0
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:04,070
To be precise this is just a part of me
that I uploaded via satellite.

0
01:24:04,870 --> 01:24:07,580
This gynoid's cyberbrain simply
doesn't have the capacity.

0
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,170
The combat control programs alone
are taking up most of its free space.

0
01:24:11,540 --> 01:24:14,500
This is the best I can do
for speech and facial expression.

0
01:24:16,050 --> 01:24:18,630
Go straight up this corridor
about 50 meters

0
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:20,420
and there ought to be
an emergency terminal.

0
01:24:21,090 --> 01:24:24,220
We'll gain access through that and
take control of the whole system.

0
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:33,600
You haven't changed
one bit.

0
01:24:33,730 --> 01:24:35,400
Get moving
point man.

0
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:38,940
I've got your back.
Just like the old days.

0
01:24:58,380 --> 01:25:01,840
"There are few who can hold up
a mirror and not become evil."

0
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:05,300
"A mirror does not expose evil;
rather it creates it."

0
01:25:05,470 --> 01:25:09,140
Hey this is no time get philosophical!
I'm running low on ammo here.

0
01:25:09,470 --> 01:25:13,940
"In short mirrors ought to be merely
glanced at not stared at."

0
01:25:14,810 --> 01:25:27,780
...and they fall from the branch
in anger.

0
01:25:58,650 --> 01:26:00,230
Hey are you okay?

0
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:03,240
It's just until I get control
of ship's receiver system.

0
01:26:03,570 --> 01:26:05,400
Jack into the auxiliary
terminal in the floor.

0
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:12,120
Until I gain control this body's
physical functions will stop.

0
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:14,580
My only defense will be
your.30 caliber Batou.

0
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:19,540
My regular brain can handle the targeting
but I'm down to one spare clip here.

0
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:22,630
If I have to go hand-to-hand with those
things I can't make any guarantees.

0
01:26:25,010 --> 01:26:26,630
I'm starting.

0
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:31,140
Illegal connection
to shipboard systems.

0
01:26:31,350 --> 01:26:34,100
Shipboard? Scan for access point
and raise attack barriers.

0
01:26:34,180 --> 01:26:36,190
Multiple virtual signals
at multiple terminals.

0
01:26:36,270 --> 01:26:38,560
No increased fluctuations in
terminal cyberbrain activity.

0
01:26:38,690 --> 01:26:40,020
Scan all external
access points.

0
01:26:40,110 --> 01:26:44,530
Sever all external connections
including home office production line.

0
01:26:44,650 --> 01:26:46,700
Physically isolate shipboard
input devices.

0
01:26:46,820 --> 01:26:50,910
No response from emergency
control systems.

0
01:26:50,990 --> 01:26:53,330
Remote ignition impossible.

0
01:26:53,410 --> 01:26:56,790
Modular viruses assembling system-wide.
System-area barriers being breached.

0
01:26:57,420 --> 01:27:01,250
Prepare for system reboot.
Commencing data isolation at level 1.

0
01:26:59,630 --> 01:27:10,220
{\an8}In the sad perpetual darkness...

0
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:21,100
{\an8}...of a hundred nights

0
01:27:21,190 --> 01:27:31,780
{\an8}they pray to the gods of the land...

0
01:27:31,910 --> 01:27:53,760
{\an8}...for the egg of the next world to be born.

0
01:27:56,100 --> 01:28:00,020
{\an8}"When we face death our life
is like a puppet on a festival cart..."

0
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:18,330
I have control. I've locked out
all external access.

0
01:28:18,620 --> 01:28:20,790
This ship is operating
in full standalone mode.

0
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:27,000
It's started moving?

0
01:28:27,130 --> 01:28:29,460
The ship is heading from the
extraterritorial Northern Frontier...

0
01:28:29,590 --> 01:28:32,880
...to a neighboring country
where the rule of law applies.

0
01:28:33,390 --> 01:28:37,640
The ship itself is hard evidence
of Locus Solus' criminal activity.

0
01:28:37,890 --> 01:28:39,270
They're gonna come
after us.

0
01:28:39,390 --> 01:28:42,020
Ships will turn up before then
to escort us in.

0
01:28:42,100 --> 01:28:43,810
I've already sent out
a request.

0
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:46,480
Now care to take a peek behind
the curtain and see what magic spell...

0
01:28:46,610 --> 01:28:49,280
...Locus Solus used to breathe
souls into these dolls?

0
01:28:50,570 --> 01:28:52,200
You don't know already?

0
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:57,330
You have your suspicions too.
Don't you.

0
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:18,010
There's no noise at all. This chamber
is completely EM-shielded?

0
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:33,950
Ghost dubbing...

0
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:37,530
The technology was able to produce
multiple degraded copies in animal tests

0
01:29:38,030 --> 01:29:42,870
but it was banned when they learned
that it destroyed the brain of the original.

0
01:29:43,290 --> 01:29:47,210
They take the kids they smuggled in
using the Koujinkai's routes

0
01:29:47,290 --> 01:29:50,550
brainwash them and dub their Ghosts
into those gynoids' bodies.

0
01:29:51,670 --> 01:29:55,260
So this is the secret behind the popularity
of Locus Solus' gynoids...

0
01:29:58,180 --> 01:30:17,610
Please help us...

0
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:03,290
You came to save us!
Mr. Vaucanson said you would!

0
01:31:03,580 --> 01:31:07,540
He was sure that people from the police
would come! That they would save us!

0
01:31:07,830 --> 01:31:12,380
I'm a stage 4 but my friend Sowana has
already been moved up to stage 5.

0
01:31:13,170 --> 01:31:16,470
She can't hear anything
and she doesn't answer me anymore.

0
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:21,930
The murdered inspector tweaked their
ethics code to try to help these children

0
01:31:22,390 --> 01:31:25,970
and when he was found out he was
served up to the yakuza as their boss' killer.

0
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:27,680
That's the long
and short of it.

0
01:31:29,770 --> 01:31:34,110
He said that if the robots caused accidents
someone would figure it out!

0
01:31:34,610 --> 01:31:36,940
Someone would come
help us!

0
01:31:38,780 --> 01:31:41,990
Didn't it ever occur to you
that there would be victims?

0
01:31:44,740 --> 01:31:46,620
I'm not talking about
the humans.

0
01:31:47,330 --> 01:31:51,460
Didn't you stop to think what would happen
to the dolls that were given souls?

0
01:31:55,130 --> 01:31:59,550
But I...
I didn't...

0
01:32:00,510 --> 01:32:03,350
I didn't want to
turn into a doll!

0
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:15,070
"We are saddened by a bird's cry
but not a fish's blood."

0
01:32:15,270 --> 01:32:17,530
"Blessed are those
with voices."

0
01:32:18,190 --> 01:32:20,150
If those dolls
had voices

0
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:23,370
I bet they would have screamed
"I don't want to be a human!"

0
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:28,870
Let me ask you something.
Are you happy the way you are now?

0
01:32:29,330 --> 01:32:31,330
I haven't seen things that way
for a long time.

0
01:32:31,420 --> 01:32:34,540
At the very least I can say that
I'm at peace with myself now.

0
01:32:38,340 --> 01:32:41,470
"Let a man walk alone
let him commit no sin."

0
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:44,180
"Let him have
few wishes..."

0
01:32:44,470 --> 01:32:47,970
"...like an elephant
in the forest."

0
01:32:48,930 --> 01:32:51,100
Don't forget
Batou.

0
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:57,020
Whenever you access the net
I'll be there at your side.

0
01:33:02,030 --> 01:33:03,610
Time to go.

0
01:33:14,210 --> 01:33:31,890
{\an8}Gods in Heaven smile upon us.

0
01:33:45,530 --> 01:33:49,830
She appeared to you on that ship
didn't she? Your guardian angel.

0
01:33:51,290 --> 01:33:54,960
Being tight-lipped again huh? Why?
You think I'll include it in my report?

0
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:57,460
I'll come pick you up
at 0800 tomorrow.

0
01:33:57,590 --> 01:34:00,630
I need to repay you for
looking after my gal too.

0
01:34:02,510 --> 01:34:05,010
How about it?
Want to come in?

0
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:09,100
Getting all warm and fuzzy with
someone else's family isn't my thing.

0
01:34:10,810 --> 01:34:11,930
Daddy!

0
01:34:13,230 --> 01:34:15,390
Did you bring me a present?
Where's my present?

0
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:17,590
- I didn't forget. Here.
- Yay!
