1
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:45,167
Are you there?

2
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,709
I'm here.

3
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,179
Help me.
My client is going to jail.

4
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,241
Oh, no, she's not.

5
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:53,785
I think I've got it.

6
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:55,912
Really?

7
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:58,480
Look up Hasson v. Conrad.

8
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,355
Similar circumstantial
evidence...

9
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:02,088
case was thrown out.

10
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,357
Legaleagle, thank you.

11
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:06,956
You are by far
the most brilliant mind

12
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:08,466
in this chat room.

13
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,298
Thank you, Lawyer-girl.

14
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:14,067
I realize we have
certain anonymity here,

15
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,973
but do you, by any chance,
have a name?

16
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,979
It's Charlene.

17
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:37,659
I missed you yesterday.

18
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:41,761
How was your day?

19
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:43,200
Uneventful.

20
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,499
I exercised for an hour
in the morning,

21
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:47,938
poked around in the yard
in the afternoon,

22
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:51,408
and visited with a girlfriend
down the block in the evening.

23
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:53,139
Sounds innocent enough.

24
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:55,681
Don't let my humdrum day
fool you, now.

25
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:58,512
I also have a very dark side.

27
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,561
Well, I'm 31

28
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,866
with long, flowing locks
and an athletic body.

29
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:20,701
Peter, what do you look like?

30
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:30,472
I'm... a little older...
6'2".

31
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,077
My hair is...
it's light.

32
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,748
Uh, it's boyishly light.

34
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,789
And good night to you,
Lawyer-girl.

38
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:28,436
Gendler.

40
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,640
- Good morning, Mr. Sanderson.
- Hi.

41
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:35,806
Morning, Peter.

42
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,042
How are you?

44
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:41,551
Gentlemen.

45
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,953
Oh, good. Peter's here.
We can begin.

46
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:46,253
Okay.
On to pressing business.

47
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:47,588
Word has come to us

48
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,629
that coffee heiress
Mrs. Virginia Arness

49
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,892
has dismissed
her current tax lawyers.

50
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,593
Virginia Arness.

51
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:57,363
74 years old, born and raised
in Athens, Georgia.

52
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:58,529
At the age of 13,

53
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,539
she was shipped off to
boarding school in England,

54
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,768
where she's been residing
until just recently.

55
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,639
That was only two days ago.

56
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,178
Impressive.

57
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,941
Now, we've all heard

58
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:11,950
that Mrs. Arness has
a penchant for thriftiness.

59
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:15,283
And that she brings new meaning
to the term "conservative."

60
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:17,619
It's not going to be easy.

61
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,215
She's paranoid
and suspicious. Peter...

62
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,521
I'm her guy.

63
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,222
I'm single.
I'll give her nights, weekends.

64
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:25,889
Aren't you getting married
on Sunday, Todd?

65
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:27,728
That's flexible.

66
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,234
And, Peter, I wouldn't
want this to interfere

67
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:32,294
with your family's
Hawaiian vacation.

68
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:33,805
You go on.

69
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:35,500
I got it all taken care of.

70
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:37,868
<i>Mahalo.</i>

71
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:42,137
Well, that's very admirable
of you, Todd.

72
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:45,241
I mean, your youth
definitely makes you an ass...

73
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,382
...et to the company,

74
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,888
especially at the annual
softball game.

75
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,393
But to an archconservative,
74-year-old woman?

76
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:58,726
What will we do is not charge
Mrs. Arness one single red cent

77
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,163
for her estate planning.

78
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:02,356
Why?

79
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,562
Because we don't care
about that measly fee.

80
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,197
We use it as a loss leader
to get her corporate business,

81
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:11,403
the multibillion-dollar
Arness coffee conglomerate.

83
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,576
Hmm.

84
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:30,956
How may I help you, Howie?

85
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,430
Just thought I'd congratulate
you on turning it around.

86
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,364
Turning what around?

87
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:37,096
You snaked Gendler.

88
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,604
Please.
Gendler doesn't bother me.

90
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:43,171
Oh, that's right.
He doesn't bother you.

91
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:45,233
What the heck was I thinking?

92
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,175
Listen, I thought
maybe after work

93
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:49,771
you and me go tie one on,

94
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,874
maybe check out
some of the local talent.

95
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:54,010
Can't. I'm meeting
Mrs. Arness at 6:00.

96
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:56,248
And by the way,
it's "You and I go tie one on,"

97
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:57,584
not "You and me go."

98
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:59,318
Somebody messaging you here.

99
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:00,586
Who's Lawyer-girl?

100
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,589
Nobody.

101
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:06,757
Whoa. Did someone make
a blind Internet date?

102
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,199
No. I mean, you know,
well, technically, but no.

103
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:11,964
I met her
in a legal chat room.

104
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,563
She's, uh, very classy
and smart.

105
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,971
When do you nail her?

106
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,600
I'm courting her tonight
at 7:00.

107
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:19,838
Oh, jeez. You're courting her.
Sounds like a hot one.

108
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:21,004
And this is her?

109
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,604
Yeah, she's attractive,
isn't she?

110
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,240
I suppose.
It's not my cup of tea.

111
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:27,013
What do you...
she is universally cute.

112
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:29,145
Eh, she's a little too
anemic-Iooking, Petey.

113
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,918
I like my jello to jiggle,
if I'm not being too subtle.

114
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:33,481
You're not being too subtle.

115
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:36,824
All right, as long as she spins
your knobs, I'm happy for you.

117
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,756
Have you nailed anyone
since Kate?

118
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,664
Nail... I was
supposed to call her.

119
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,033
Sofia, can you get my wife
on the phone?

120
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:46,503
- Ex-wife.
- Ex-wife on the phone?

121
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:47,596
Right away.

122
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:50,198
Can't help you with this one,
pal. See you later.

124
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:55,174
Peter, you cannot break
another promise to these kids.

125
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,510
You just can't.

126
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,345
I said I couldn't take them
to Hawaii.

127
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,045
I didn't say
I couldn't take them.

128
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,643
They can spend the week
with me.

129
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:04,315
They are gonna be
so disappointed.

130
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,948
I can't talk to you right now.

132
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:16,526
Um... Daddy can't take you
to Hawaii.

133
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,070
Oh, darn.

134
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:20,901
He always does this.

136
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,708
Sanderson, party of two.

137
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,611
Oh, you're the last
to arrive.

138
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:31,172
How long has she been here?

139
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,877
Mmm, about 20 minutes.

140
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,510
Was she trouble?

142
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:40,953
Thank you.

143
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,495
Hello.
I'm Peter Sanderson.

144
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:48,697
Well, I'm glad
they didn't send a child.

145
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:52,204
I told them I specifically
wanted someone my own age.

146
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,310
What a wonderful
French bulldog.

147
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:01,903
My mother had one.
They make great companions.

148
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,949
What's her name?

149
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:09,215
His name is
William Shakespeare.

150
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:10,846
Well, of course.

151
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,522
Now, I've heard about
your unfortunate escapade.

152
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,995
I don't have escapades.

153
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:20,999
Fiasco with your
previous attorney.

154
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:23,331
The man was
a thieving criminal.

155
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:25,666
Just because I have
a lot of money

156
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:28,571
doesn't give people
the right to overcharge.

157
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:31,872
I do not enjoy
being taken advantage of.

158
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:34,879
Which is why our service
is free of charge.

159
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,972
After all, you worked hard
for your money.

160
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,482
I'm an heiress.

161
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:43,318
An heiress who worked hard
to keep her money.

162
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:47,222
Now, shall we get down
to business?

163
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:48,419
Fine.

164
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:50,792
So, now you may hand over
your proposal.

165
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,558
I'll take it with me.

166
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,365
Proposal?

167
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,994
Well, I was expecting
to meet with you tomorrow.

168
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,198
I was assured
the proposal would be ready

169
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,468
for this afternoon.

170
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,806
I see no point
in our meeting tomorrow.

171
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,402
Excuse me.
Madam, I'm sorry.

172
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,506
We have a no-dog policy
in the lounge.

173
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,484
Unfortunately, I'm gonna have
to ask you to remove the dog.

174
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,453
Excuse me.
I am Mrs. Arness' attorney,

175
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,751
and because there is no sign
posted regarding dogs,

176
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:20,223
that means there is
no policy toward dogs.

177
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,386
Now, if you want to avoid
a legal situation,

178
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:24,326
I would suggest
you run to the kitchen

179
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,763
and get some tuna tartare
for William Shakespeare

180
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:28,629
on the house.

181
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:29,963
Yes, sir.

182
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,663
I'm terribly sorry, ma'am.

183
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,606
Where and when tomorrow?

185
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:53,924
Hello, Mr. Sanderson.

186
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,291
Oh, Mrs. Kline.
Always a pleasure.

187
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,557
And when am I going to
get to babysit

188
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,963
with your charming
little Georgey again?

190
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:04,026
Oh, uh, well, uh, soon,

191
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,936
because he just loves
coming over to your place.

193
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,640
Uh, Mr. Sanderson?

194
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,908
Those Latin people
who were skulking around...

195
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:18,974
Oh. They were looking
at the Aruda house.

196
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:20,951
Casing it?

197
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,147
No, uh, to buy it.

198
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:25,383
Oh, please.

199
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,825
If they're in this block and not
carrying a leaf blower...

200
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:30,327
Yeah.

201
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:32,455
Well, I'd love to discuss this
with you further,

202
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:33,998
but I'm expecting someone.

203
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,658
Ohh.

205
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,391
Yeah.

206
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:43,730
Hey.

209
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,513
Hi.

212
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,438
Yeah.

218
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,373
I hope you like cham...

219
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:09,983
...poo.

220
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:12,353
What's up, baby?

221
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:14,654
Ooh, champagne.
I love champagne.

222
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:15,716
This for me?

223
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,320
Oh, I'm sorry. I think
you have the wrong house.

224
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:20,331
It is damn good
to finally connect.

225
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,026
Pardon me?

226
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:24,501
It's me, fool... Charlene.

227
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:25,969
Ooh, food.

228
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:27,164
What?

229
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:30,003
It's me, honey.
Your date... Lawyer-girl.

230
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:31,064
You can't be.

231
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,667
Hey, hey, hey.
Leave that alone.

232
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:33,769
Well, why can't I?

233
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,905
Because you're not a blonde.

234
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,744
Can't get nothing past you.

236
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:40,681
You must be
a bomb-ass lawyer.

237
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,051
Oh, look at all
of these pretty candles...

238
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:45,955
all romantic and shit.

239
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:49,119
Somebody was planning
on getting some booty tonight.

240
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,163
Hey! Leave that alone.
There are settings.

241
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,393
And you can't be Charlene,
because Charlene is more of...

242
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:55,558
Skinny white broad?

243
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:56,566
Yeah.

244
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,728
You know, I get that a lot.

245
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:00,897
But that's your fault
you're thinking that, bro.

246
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:03,737
You must have not have took
a good look at that picture.

247
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:05,777
I have looked
at that picture a lot,

248
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,608
and trust me,
you are not in it.

249
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,272
Mm-hmm.

251
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:20,752
Move, move, move.
Let me do it.

252
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:22,453
See?

253
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:26,622
There I am.

254
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,725
Sorry you got it
twisted, dog.

255
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:32,100
I don't get a lot of
photo ops where I been.

256
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,600
Where exactly have you been?

257
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:38,768
I got a rumble in the jungle.
We still having dinner or what?

258
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:40,334
I asked you a question.

259
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:41,538
Rolex.

260
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:42,774
Rolex?

261
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:45,009
I did time, baby,
but I ain't do the crime.

262
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:46,813
You're a convict?

263
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,012
Bump that.

264
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:49,952
Shoot,
Roscoe cracked that door.

265
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:51,956
I kicked it off the heezy
and bounced.

266
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,116
For real, though.

267
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:56,253
What did you just say?

268
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,262
What, don't you hear good?

269
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:00,757
All right.

270
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,358
Let's see.
How can I put this?

271
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:06,302
I was recently liberated
from a correctional facility...

272
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:07,703
All right. I get it.

273
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:10,537
You're in the big house, and
you get someone to type for you,

274
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:13,305
and you get on the Internet,
and you misrepresent yourself.

275
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:14,607
It happens, and I'm a sucker,

276
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,773
but now you have to go,
because this is over.

277
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,339
Unh-unh. No, no, no.

278
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,385
Biscuit,
you misrepresented yourself.

279
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:22,283
Boyishly light... please.

280
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:23,321
Gray.

281
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:25,789
You said you was
a criminal lawyer.

282
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:26,916
I pulled your file.

283
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:29,187
You're just some sorry-ass
tax attorney.

284
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,195
A tax lawyer is
a criminal lawyer.

285
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,288
Oh, yeah?

286
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:35,765
Well, good,
'cause that's why I'm here.

287
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:37,267
Well, do tell.

288
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:40,328
Well,
I want to reopen my case.

289
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:44,706
And what did you do, smoke
some homies on a drive-by?

290
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,542
Smoke? Homies?

291
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,672
Well, you a regular
gangster, huh?

292
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:54,176
No, man. I was in for armed
robbery, but I didn't do it.

293
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,345
Yeah, nobody did it.

294
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,218
I can't be having
this conversation

295
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,449
because you're a criminal-type.

296
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,458
If I was a criminal,
I would have shanked you

297
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:01,959
when I had
that knife in my hand.

298
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,359
The fact that you even said that
is a problem for me.

299
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,398
- But I didn't think that.
- It's just time to go.

300
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,956
Please, just listen to me.
Just give me one second.

301
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:10,126
No, I don't have a second.

302
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,329
Okay, can I just
say something, please?

303
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:13,336
What?

304
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:15,236
I didn't do the crime.

305
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,002
You rude mother...

307
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,801
I ain't goin'.

310
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:48,633
It's your baby,
Peter, and don't you deny it!

311
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:51,369
That DNA test told on you!

312
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:53,468
You lie, Peter!

313
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,877
You know lil' Kareem is yours!

314
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:58,142
Why?!

315
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:00,082
How you gonna do me
like that, Peter?!

316
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:04,555
You told me I was your
beautiful African Queen.

317
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:07,148
And I loved you
for that, Peter!

318
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:09,217
I didn't care if your
little thing was curved.

319
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,096
And lil' Kareem don't want
your child support.

320
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:17,124
He just want a relationship
with his white daddy.

321
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,705
A little
chocolate/vanilla swirl

322
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,173
from that magical night
at the crackhouse.

323
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:23,833
Oh!

324
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,012
Come on.
Just be quiet!

325
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,310
Wait just a second.
My shoes.

326
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,009
- Mr. Sanderson?
- Whoa!

327
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,312
Is everything okay?

328
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,785
I thought I heard Negro.

329
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:39,517
No. No Negro spoken here.

330
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,650
Oh.

331
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,696
Well... good night, then.

332
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:46,958
Oh, uh...

333
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:48,397
good night.

335
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:54,265
Come on!

336
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:56,000
Come on, come on!

337
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,107
You stay. You stay.
You wait right there.

338
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,149
Who you callin'?

339
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:05,979
The police.

341
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,221
Police department.
Sergeant Panella. Please hold.

342
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:11,449
What's that?

343
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,013
It's all of our e-mails.

344
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,026
You think anybody at Tobias,
Kline, and Barnes

345
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,686
would be interested
in hearing

346
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,322
about you looking for Boom-boom
in the federal pen?

347
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:22,026
And I'll send a photo.

348
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,625
Thanks for holding.
Can I help you?

350
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,568
Now, this is just
for tonight, understand?

351
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:37,715
A'ight.

352
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,047
I can work with this.

353
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,246
But, uh, look,
don't be gettin' no ideas

354
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,755
about sneakin' up in here
and hittin' this ass,

355
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:47,417
'cause you blew your chance
with this fine sister.

356
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,723
Dare to dream.

357
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,888
Tsk. Please.

360
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:58,365
Oh, my God! A bed!

361
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:01,235
Oh, a nice, big, cushy bed.

362
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,900
Ohh, no roommates,
no cellmates.

365
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:22,624
Charlene?

366
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,796
Charlene.

368
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:31,596
Charlene! Come on,
you're not fooling anybody.

369
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:35,101
Who that? Who there?

370
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,937
Who want it with Lene?

371
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:40,277
I put some bagels outside.

372
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,745
I thought
we could discuss your case.

373
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,540
Ahh!

374
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,551
What up, dog?
Where 'em bagels at?

375
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:50,179
Hey, guess what, girlfriend?
Your game is up.

376
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:51,847
Because I burned
all those e-mails,

377
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,449
including the second set hidden
in the lining of your coat.

378
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,721
And I deleted everything
off my computer.

379
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:59,787
So I never met you,
and you never met me.

380
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:03,232
Don't even try, girlfriend,
because it's locked.

381
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:07,762
And now I am going to go
get my kids,

382
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,272
as in innocent young persons

383
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,309
who will never even know
you were here.

384
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,741
So now just go.

385
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:15,211
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go!

386
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,838
And locky locky!

387
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:17,939
So ta-ta.

388
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:20,109
And watch out.
The gate closes automatically.

389
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:21,209
Well, what about my stuff?

390
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:23,083
Oh, it's right there
on the street.

391
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:24,782
You put my stuff
on the trash?

392
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:26,824
Oh. Well, you know what?

393
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,416
I wish you well.
I really do.

394
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:30,688
And you know what?
I had a great, great time.

395
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:31,820
It was really fun.

396
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,194
So, oh, well.

397
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:35,233
I guess I'll just see you
in my next life.

398
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,325
Heh heh heh heh. Bye!

400
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:42,162
Ha ha. I'll see you
when you get home.

401
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,777
So I said to him,

402
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:52,180
"Just 'cause you whisked me
to Paris on your private jet

403
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,378
doesn't mean
I'm gonna sleep with you."

404
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,284
What does he think I am?
A hooker?

405
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:59,950
Can Aunt Ashley
edit herself, please?

406
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,220
You stayed in
the same room with him.

407
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:03,386
What did you expect?

408
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:05,828
Hello. It was a suite...
plenty of floor space.

409
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:08,024
Sweetiepie, have a wonderful
time. I love you.

410
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,796
Please be good to your brother
and help him with his reading.

411
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:12,166
- I will.
- Thank you.

412
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:15,070
Is he still having problems?

413
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,075
Oh, he struggles every day,
but he's improving.

414
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:20,407
Dad's here.

415
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,674
Thank you, sweetiepie.

416
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:24,215
Don't worry, sweetie.

417
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,877
Daddy's stupid, too,
and he became a lawyer.

418
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:27,884
Ashley!

419
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,215
I'm not stupid.

420
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,051
- That's right.
- No, no, no. Of course not.

421
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,181
Hey, Dad's here.

422
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:34,248
Speak of the dummy.

423
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:36,351
Hey, how's my little girl
doin', huh?

424
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:37,656
Hi, Dad.

425
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:39,162
Hey, how's it goin', big guy?

426
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:40,698
Ahhh, here you go.

427
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:43,056
Hi, Kate.

428
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:45,168
Hi.

429
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:47,899
Oh, Ashley, I didn't realize
you were gonna be here.

430
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,235
What a pleasant surprise.

431
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,072
Peter,
you're almost aging well.

432
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,272
Okay, I thought we'd go down
to the club and take a swim.

433
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:57,713
Ooh, that sounds
much more fun than Maui.

434
00:21:57,783 --> 00:21:59,910
You know, Ashley,
not all of us earn our living

435
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,112
by milking rich geriatrics
out of their money.

436
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:03,916
Some of us have to work
for a living.

437
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:07,083
You sound much more intelligent
with your mouth shut.

438
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,854
Let's not start this.
I don't have time.

439
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:10,588
Kids, go get your stuff.

440
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,856
All right, fine.

441
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,488
But I warned you

442
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:16,898
about marrying the first
jerk-off you met out of college.

443
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:18,959
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a date.

444
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:20,971
<i>Don't</i> be good.

445
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:24,407
What morgue did you find
this one at?

446
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,569
Stop being so childish.

448
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,974
Hey.

449
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:35,919
Wow.
You look beautiful.

450
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:37,079
Thank you.

451
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:39,146
Mmm.

452
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:41,249
Uh, hi.

453
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:43,317
Uh, Peter, this is Glen.

454
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:45,454
Hey.

455
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,828
Hey, Mr. Sanderson.
Nice to see you.

456
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:49,230
Yeah, nice to meet you.

457
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:52,862
Uh, what do you say
we get this road on the show?

458
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:53,996
Okay.

459
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:56,265
I will meet you outside.

460
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:57,672
Okay.

461
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:58,675
Road on the show.

462
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:00,507
Just don't.

463
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:01,944
How old is he?

464
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:03,310
Younger.

465
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,906
- What does he do?
- Golf instructor.

466
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:06,473
- How do you know that?
- What?

467
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,109
Well, you think
you know somebody,

468
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:10,654
and then one day you wake up
in Thailand missing a kidney.

469
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:14,123
He could have made up
this whole golf identity.

470
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:16,752
He caddied for you
when he was 14.

471
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:19,990
That's little Glenny?

472
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,958
Does that bother you?

473
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:24,126
Not at all.

474
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:26,932
Go have fun
on your statutory weekend.

476
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:33,740
This does too bother you.
I know you.

477
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,505
Do you want to talk
about it?

478
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,549
Well, it just looks
a little silly.

479
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,551
Hang on.

480
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:41,711
Hello?

481
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:44,779
Some things never change.

482
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:47,120
I can't talk right now.

483
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:49,251
Well, put him on.

484
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:50,624
Hi.

485
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:53,289
You promised us
you'd take us snorkeling.

486
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,094
Things come up.
That's life.

487
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,294
I know.
I'm really, really sorry.

488
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:00,304
But now it's over. It's new.
We're gonna have a lot of fun.

489
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:03,102
Now, what's new?
What's new with you?

490
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:07,305
Well, I got the female lead
in the school play "Oklahoma!"

491
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:10,338
Hey, that's great.
Congratulations.

492
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:12,383
And how 'bout you, big guy?
How's school?

493
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:13,884
I don't like school.

494
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,283
Well, nobody likes school,

495
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:17,753
but there must be something
you like about it.

496
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:20,121
He got into a fight
the other day.

497
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:22,524
Why?
Why'd you get in a fight?

498
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:26,792
Some kids called me a baby
'cause of the way I read.

499
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:29,800
Some of the greatest minds of
all time had trouble learning,

500
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:34,601
like Edgar Allan Poe
and Albert Einstein

501
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:36,197
and, uh, Ozzy Osbourne.

503
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:38,774
Ozzy rules.

504
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:40,744
Ozzy rules. Okay.

506
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:46,940
Dad, what's goin' on?

507
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:48,952
You two wait here.
I'll be right back.

509
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:54,025
Hey!

510
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:56,458
Whoa, whoa. Where you think
you're goin', milk?

511
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:58,359
This here's
a charitable event.

512
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:01,092
You wants to get in,
you gots to make a donation.

513
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,532
Trust me, it is
off the hook in there.

514
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:05,194
Off the what?
I live here.

515
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:08,702
I don't care
if you're Halle Berry, man.

516
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:10,638
No donation, no entry.

517
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:13,371
How 'bout
if I call the police?

519
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,875
Have a nice time.

524
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:36,325
Oh, yeah.

525
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:38,096
Yeah, baby, show me.

526
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:40,797
Hey! What the hell
is going on here?

527
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,669
Oh, yo, P., it's cool.

528
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:44,231
See, I hit up my homegirl

529
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:46,675
'cause I had to get my hair
done, as we both know.

530
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:49,873
And then she called a friend.
They holler to other friends.

531
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:52,246
Before you know it,
we got us a house par-ty.

532
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,084
I want everyone
out of here now!

533
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:58,486
People!

534
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,320
People!

535
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,917
Loosen your panties, Grandma.

536
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:05,827
Look, you lock me out,
no money, no place to go.

537
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,661
I mean, a girl got to get
her cheese on.

538
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,530
Seven.

539
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:11,830
This is insane!

540
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,962
My boss' sister lives
across the street.

541
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,132
I can't have all these peop...

542
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:18,873
Hey!

543
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:21,003
Give me a hard seven, baby.

544
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,376
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

545
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:24,745
She doesn't even have
her driver's permit.

546
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:25,748
Dad.

547
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:27,114
Do not go...

548
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:28,482
Roll! Uh!

549
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:30,020
Come on.

550
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,385
Don't inhale.

551
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:34,892
All right, now. Go on
and toss them bones, lil' man.

552
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:36,887
Hey! Give me...

553
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,122
I'm on a roll, Dad.

554
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,494
Get out.

555
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:45,468
I want you and your dogs
to go back to the pound now.

556
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:46,868
What?

559
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,535
Well, it was the dogs?

560
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,544
Because she said dogs,
and then I said dogs,

561
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,910
so I assumed
that would be okay.

562
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:57,209
Huh?

565
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:07,519
Whoo!

566
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,187
Tsk.

568
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,600
Bye, Tamika.
Y'all be good, now.

569
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:16,827
Bye.

570
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:20,260
Hey, hey.
Y'all got to go.

571
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:22,272
- A'ight.
- That's a'ight.

572
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:26,543
Hey, baby, gonna go.

573
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:29,079
Oh, bye, Bear.
Thank you so much.

574
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,513
Party's over.
Okay. Thanks for coming.

575
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:33,210
But that's it. It's over.

576
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:35,684
If I see Widow around,
I'm gonna tell him you're out.

577
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:37,244
You know
he wants to know that.

578
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,187
I don't know about that.
I'll see you.

579
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:40,724
- Okay. Bye, baby.
- Bye-bye.

580
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:43,860
It's like this.

581
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:44,952
Hey.

582
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,520
- How you doin', neighbor?
- What's up?

583
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,902
What are you still doing here?

584
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:55,201
- What was all that, Dad?
- Dad, who's this?

585
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:56,365
This is no one.

586
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:57,840
Tsk! What's up, lil' Romeo?

587
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:59,638
My name is Charlene.
What's your name?

588
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:00,473
I'm Georgey.

589
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:02,570
You cannot meet
a nonexistent person.

590
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:04,877
Can Charlene come to the club?

591
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:06,416
Club? What club?

592
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:08,384
We're not going to a club,
remember?

593
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:10,887
We're going to Hawaii,
remember?

594
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:12,946
Okay, you know the routine.
Outski!

595
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,924
- Out! Let's go.
- Come on, man!

596
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:16,790
Sarah, get the door.
Come on. Out.

597
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,385
Out, out, out!

599
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:21,789
- Wait!
- What?

600
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,197
Give me my money, lil' boy.

601
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:24,826
That money should go
to charity!

602
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:25,961
Ohh!

604
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:31,305
What did...

605
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,673
Hey, I live here.

606
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:34,177
Yeah!

607
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:37,303
What?

608
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:44,482
Okay, you guys.

609
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:48,492
You know, you order hot dogs,
and you splash and frolic

610
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,051
and just put everything on
my account and just have fun.

611
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:52,756
Didn't you bring
your bathing suit?

612
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:55,425
Oh, no.
I'm having tea with a client.

613
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,627
But I will be right back.

614
00:28:57,702 --> 00:28:59,431
Whatever you say.

615
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:01,404
Want to go swimming?

616
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:02,462
With you?

617
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,802
Forget you.

618
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:04,807
Ow!

619
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:06,343
How's it looking?

620
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,402
Well, I was up all night
proofing.

621
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,107
It's absolutely brilliant.

622
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:12,911
And you've got the cleanest
background check I've ever seen.

623
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:15,475
That background check
cost me a lot of fun in my life.

624
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:17,953
I don't know, honey.

625
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,887
Don't say anything.
She could hear you.

626
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,016
What's crackin', ma?

627
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,026
I'm lookin'
for the Sanderson table.

628
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,561
We old college buddies.

629
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:27,223
O-O-Okay.
He's i-in the dining room.

630
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:28,287
I-I'll show you.

631
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:29,355
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

632
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,698
I tell you what...
I'll surprise him.

634
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,572
No, you're in great shape.
I'm gonna take off.

635
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:40,076
All right, you're right.
Nothing could go wrong.

636
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:42,613
I've done this a million times
with important clients,

637
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,772
so I'm fine.

638
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:45,110
- Shazam.
- What?

640
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:48,174
Oh, no.

641
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:53,421
Oh, swing it,
you cocoa goddess.

642
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:56,426
Cocoa Goddess? That's the rude
shock I was telling you about.

643
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:57,825
That's Charlene?

644
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:00,489
Did she see me?

645
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:05,699
Okay, okay, okay, police.

646
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,102
Uh, no.
Won't get here fast enough.

647
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:09,504
Uh, security.

648
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:12,042
No, she could probably
take him.

655
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:26,423
Uh, money.

656
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:29,450
She'll take money.

657
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:32,519
Hi, hi. Here, just...
Here's whatever.

658
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:35,589
And there's more where that came
from if you just leave now.

659
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,135
No. Unh-unh, boyfriend.
We got business.

660
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:39,602
Boyfriend?

661
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,798
Oh, didn't I tell you?
We're dating now.

662
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:43,135
It's some kind of street talk.

663
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,937
It's street for
"I'm not going nowhere

664
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,636
until you help my problem
go away."

665
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:49,805
Look, Mrs. Arness,
a very important client,

666
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:52,247
is due here any minute.

667
00:30:57,555 --> 00:30:58,647
Good afternoon.

668
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:00,623
Good afternoon.
Mr. Sanderson?

669
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,284
Oh, yes.
He's in the dining room.

670
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,260
Thank you.

671
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,354
Charlene, how 'bout you and I

672
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:09,423
havin' a smart cocktail
down by the pool?

673
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,762
Who is this fool?

674
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:13,235
That's a good idea.
Just put it on my bill.

675
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:16,000
I don't want no smart cocktail.
I need your help.

676
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:17,507
Miss.

677
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:18,940
Another martini.

678
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:21,171
Oh, hell, no.
I know she ain't talkin' to me.

679
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:22,804
Ashley,
she doesn't work here.

680
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,076
If she isn't here to work,
then what is she here for?

681
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:28,277
Oh, hells no, Miss Thing.
You best pump your brakes.

682
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:29,684
She's my ex-wife's sister.

683
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:31,745
I would have killed her
myself years ago.

684
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:33,814
It's Mrs. Arness!

685
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:39,960
Mmm. Old Iron Ass
be lookin' mean.

686
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:41,464
Yes. You have to go.

687
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:43,261
You like raw oysters,
Charlene?

688
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:48,271
Yeah. I guess
I can hang out for a bit.

689
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:50,466
They got any hot wings
around here?

690
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:52,940
All right.
Whatever you want. Yes.

691
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:54,535
- You give me a place to stay?
- Yes.

692
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:56,637
- And you work on my case?
- Around the clock.

693
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:58,113
I'll leave
when you expunge my record.

694
00:31:58,182 --> 00:31:59,809
Consider it expunged.

695
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:03,943
All right.
I'd like a key, please.

698
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:09,452
Mr. Sanderson?

699
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:11,392
Mrs. Arness.

700
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:14,397
Who is your associate?

701
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:18,060
This is Howie Rottman,
the attorney I told you about.

702
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:20,661
A great pleasure
to meet you, Mrs. Arness.

703
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:21,796
I meant her.

704
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:23,500
Oh.

705
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:24,563
Her?

706
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:25,574
Her?

707
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:27,338
Her is... her...

708
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:30,040
She is our... our nanny.

709
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:33,106
Dad, I'm bored.

710
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:35,152
Kids, how good to see you.

711
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:38,279
Don't we just love
our nanny, Charlene?

713
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:42,556
Uh... Y-yeah.

714
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:48,325
Don't you just love being
our nanny, Charlene?

716
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,173
Yessir.

718
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:02,908
Now I'm gonna go on down
to the pool with the child'n.

719
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,677
Maybe we make fun of the white
folks again, huh, kids?

720
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,910
Ooh-hoo!

721
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,782
Oh, the kids just love her.

722
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:10,377
- What a sense of humor.
- Yeah.

723
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:12,423
Peter, I'm going to hang
by the pool.

724
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,458
If you need me,
that's where I'll be.

725
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:16,288
Mrs. Arness.

726
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:17,919
Uh, right this way,
Mrs. Arness.

727
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,486
Come, William.

728
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:20,792
You have the papers?

729
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:22,298
Oh, yes, yes, I do.

730
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:23,994
Strange clothes for a nanny.

731
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:26,036
Well, it's a fashion to kids.

732
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,095
- Ow!
- William, mind.

733
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,383
Hello, Sanderson family!

735
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,823
Georgey,
don't forget poker night!

736
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,152
I won't.

737
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:49,216
How could I forget
poker night?

740
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:09,604
I propose a toast.

741
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,669
Okay.

742
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:11,942
Mm-hmm.

743
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:13,916
To us.

744
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:17,215
May we always...

746
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:21,052
- Mmm.
- Sorry. It's mine.

747
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:23,059
Oh, you're not gonna
answer that, are you?

748
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:28,121
Well, it might be...
might be one of my kids.

749
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,064
Just one minute.

751
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:37,031
Sorry.

753
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:39,434
Hello?

754
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,875
Hey, it's me.

755
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:42,936
Oh, hi, Ashley.
Everything okay?

756
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:45,482
I don't know.

757
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,848
I saw Peter hanging out
at the club today.

758
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,183
He was mingling with
a large black woman.

759
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,950
What? What are you
talking about?

760
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:54,514
He said it was his nanny.

761
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,026
She didn't look like any nanny
I'd ever seen.

762
00:34:57,095 --> 00:35:01,623
She was all...
tattooed and welfarish.

763
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:03,530
It was...

764
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,229
Oh, is that funny to you?
Is that funny?

766
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:09,132
Am I funny to you?

767
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:10,834
No, no.
That's not funny.

768
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:11,875
Were you laughing at me?

769
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,433
Oh, I wasn't...

770
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:14,671
Stop. Get away.

771
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:17,475
No, I wasn't
laughing at you.

772
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:19,175
Just... hang on.

773
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:22,083
Um, you know, look,
I know Peter. I know him.

774
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:24,678
He's not gonna spend all his
time taking care of the kids.

775
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:25,881
He went and hired somebody!

776
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,187
Seriously, Kate!
This woman was no nanny.

777
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:30,159
You need to do something.

778
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:31,752
I saw this woman.
I was there.

779
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:34,059
Shouldn't you at least
be looking at references?

780
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,724
Thank you. Thank you.

781
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,099
Listen, Peter is nothing
if not responsible.

782
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,832
It's not like he's gonna
hire a convicted felon.

783
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:43,931
Oh, I wouldn't be too sure
about that.

784
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:44,940
Ohh!

785
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:47,807
Let's see... we got resisting
arrest, assaulting an officer,

786
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:49,904
repeated attempts
at eye-gouging,

787
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,449
and... scrotum crushing.

788
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:54,917
Well, I was a little riled up,
being framed and all.

789
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:58,080
And your clothes and I.D.
Were found at the scene.

790
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,124
All plants.
I never robbed nobody!

791
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:02,455
Okay.

792
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:04,290
I know my rights.
I get an appeal.

793
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:05,624
I get an appeal!

794
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:08,460
You only get an appeal if you
were convicted and incarcerated.

795
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:10,592
You were released.

796
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,397
Look, why don't you just
start over?

798
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:16,266
Go back to school and get
at least a passing familiarity

799
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,604
With the English language.

800
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,576
It's no end
to what you can accomplish

801
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:21,805
with a little commitment.

802
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:23,608
My daughter Sarah
is fully committed,

803
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:26,081
and she's going places.

804
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:29,418
Oh, she's goin' places,
all right.

805
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:32,581
So, it's a charitable
remainder trust.

806
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:35,125
That way, the old tightwad gets
a huge deduction every year.

808
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:37,922
Uh, no more calls, Sofia.

809
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:39,929
It's not a call.
There's someone here...

810
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:41,328
Girl, get out!

811
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:42,889
I do not know who you are...

812
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:45,265
Send her in.

813
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:48,636
Bet you know me now, huh?

814
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,140
This couldn't wait
until tonight?

815
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,437
Well, well, well!

816
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,977
Come in, have a seat,
spend some time.

817
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,910
Thanks, homeboy,
and, no, it can't wait.

818
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,004
You gotta check this out.

819
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:58,912
- What is it?
- I found the deposition.

820
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:00,917
The prosecution interviewed
an eyewitness,

821
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:03,044
and she told them
that the perpetrator

822
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,350
didn't have a tattoo
on the chest.

823
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:07,414
They never told my lawyer
about this shit.

824
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:08,458
That's withholding exculp...

825
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:11,324
Exculpatory evidence.
People vs. Stanley, I know.

826
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:13,959
How do you know that?

827
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:16,864
Why wouldn't she know that?
She's got it goin' on.

828
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:19,425
Damn, Pete, all I did in there
was read law books.

829
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:21,027
And with comprehension.

830
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:22,766
Made you think I was a lawyer.

831
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,673
I mean, you obviously have
pockets of intelligence.

832
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:30,806
So, why do you walk and talk
and act the way you do?

833
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:32,439
Because it's sexy.

834
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:35,716
It ain't actin'!

835
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:36,980
This is who I am.

836
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:39,488
I mean, you think
I can't talk like you?

837
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:40,819
Oh, Peter,

838
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:43,018
I absolutely love what
you've done with the place!

839
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:46,655
It's so sterile, so...
so bland, so wonderful!

840
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:48,358
See? You can do it.

841
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,297
Oh, you like that, huh?

842
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:52,199
Well, you can kiss
my natural black ass,

843
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,396
because I don't need
your approval.

844
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:55,564
No, she don't need
your approval.

845
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,165
Hey, you don't think
I compromise the way I act?

846
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:01,177
You think I like walking around
like an uptight... honky?

847
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:04,011
Yes. I know your lingo.

849
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:08,480
Peter, Mr. Tobias
is coming to see you.

850
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:09,541
Oh, God.

851
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:12,220
Well, this should be
interesting.

852
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,157
Uh-oh. What we gotta do,
play "hide the sister"?

853
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:17,660
Or do I gotta do
that slave thing again?

854
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:20,219
Just... just act natural.

855
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:24,029
- Let's get her out of here.
- Why don't we get her out?

858
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:37,680
Peter... Howie.

859
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:39,511
Ed.

860
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:40,880
Who is this?

861
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:43,146
- Uh, this is the...
- Well, we were just having...

862
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:46,121
Well, Mr. Sanderson,
I can see you are very busy.

863
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,215
That's why I really
appreciate you

864
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,522
offering your services
free of charge.

865
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:52,892
Oh, I... well,
I just... gosh.

866
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:54,260
Peter...

867
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,424
She is...

868
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,228
Well, see,
Mr. Sanderson here,

869
00:38:57,301 --> 00:38:59,667
being the heavenly man
that he is...

870
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,136
God bless you!

871
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:03,503
Oh, you got that anointing
on you...

872
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:06,737
...has offered to do the taxes
for the Compton Evangelistic

873
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:09,279
Episcopal Baptist church
of South Central.

874
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,747
You know,
just anything to help

875
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:13,807
Reverend Shack... tillfont.

877
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:16,244
Just call him Shack.

878
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,344
Shack.

879
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:18,911
Well, I'll let you guys go.

880
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:21,048
I'll see you at choir rehearsal
on Thursday.

881
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:22,251
7:00, now!

883
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:27,855
I'll escort
Mrs. Shacktill... font

884
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:29,160
to the elevator.

885
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:30,666
Gentlemen.

886
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:33,636
Uh, Peter,
we're really in a crunch.

887
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:36,002
I just got word that another
firm's in the running

888
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:37,472
for the R<i>&</i>S account.

889
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,065
We need to close this deal.

890
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:40,235
Look...

891
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:42,438
I have no problem being
Peter's wingman on this one.

892
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:45,448
Oh, well, thanks anyway, but I
really have it under control,

893
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:47,450
so, you don't have to worry
about a thing, Ed.

894
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:50,487
Good. Then I'll expect you
to wrap it up in a day or two.

895
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,749
That's the plan, certainly.

896
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:54,313
Ah.

897
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:06,331
Well.

898
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:10,839
Could you...

899
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:12,671
- Sure.
- Thank you.

900
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,820
Thank you.

901
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:26,823
She can't tee up her own ball?

902
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:31,260
I've been playing this game
for many years...

903
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:32,852
That's what it feels like.

904
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,125
...and it's all about
patience.

905
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:55,215
Well, you beat me by 19.

906
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,481
MRS. ARNESS:
Uh, let's make it 20.

907
00:40:57,555 --> 00:40:58,579
All right.

908
00:40:58,656 --> 00:40:59,953
Mrs. Arness, I was wondering

909
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:01,958
if you'd like to come over
to my house on Thursday

910
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:04,187
and possibly
look over the contract.

911
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:06,422
I'll have to check with
my secretary, Julia.

912
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:08,727
Mrs. Arness, would you
excuse me for a minute?

913
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,562
I just have to
check on my children.

914
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,226
Oh, of course.
You do that.

915
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,328
I'd like to dip you
in Cheez Whiz

916
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:16,532
and spread you over
a Ritz Cracker,

917
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:18,199
if I'm not being too subtle.

918
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:22,245
Boy, you are
some kind of freaky.

919
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,974
Oh, you have no idea.

920
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:25,879
You got me
straight trippin', boo.

921
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:28,510
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, what are you doing here?

922
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:30,554
What does it look like?
I'm on a date.

923
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:31,383
On a date.

924
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:34,253
She's on a date?
She's a felon.

925
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,953
- I am not a felon.
- Hey, what is she doing here?

926
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:38,392
Get used to it, Twiggy.

927
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:40,896
You're gonna be seeing
a lot more of me around here.

928
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:42,557
Not without a broom
in your hand.

929
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:45,864
If I have, it's 'cause I'm here
to sweep up the white trash.

930
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:48,302
Save it for the YMCA, Jemima.

931
00:41:48,372 --> 00:41:50,704
Bitch! I'm gonna kick
the bulimia out of your ass!

932
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:53,106
Have you ever had
a tempered moment?

933
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,839
Why don't you go back to the
vodka bottle you crawled out of?

934
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:56,902
Mrs. Arness is here.

935
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:58,915
I am sheltering you.
I'm helping you.

936
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:00,143
Remember, I helped you...

937
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:02,481
All right!
I'll let it ride.

938
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:05,317
Thank you for letting it ride.
That is wise and mature.

939
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:07,380
Now, just get her walking
that way.

940
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:09,585
Let me show you the place,
Charlene.

941
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:13,725
Looking good, Lois!

942
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:16,566
Hey, freak boy...

943
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:20,001
I'm gonna make myself a little
more luscious for you, okay?

944
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,731
I'll be right back.

945
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,838
Okay, precious.

947
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:37,252
What are you doin' in here?

948
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:39,755
I told you you was gonna be
seein' more of me, right?

949
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:41,916
Look, I came here to warn you.

950
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:43,357
You keep disrespecting me,

951
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:45,520
and it's gonna get rough
around here.

952
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:48,189
Back off, Shaniqua.

953
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:49,425
You don't scare me.

954
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,694
You know what? That's it.

955
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:53,965
You must need a little more
eye shadow, right? Come on!

959
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:06,007
You've messed with
the wrong W.A.S.P., bitch.

967
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:31,072
Compliments of Tae-Bo,

968
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:33,336
two hours a day,
five days a week.

982
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:15,913
Compliments of the 'hood,
24 hours a day, all my life.

987
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:29,024
You know, for a skinny white ho,
you're pretty tough.

993
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:52,614
And I don't <i>ever</i> want to have
this conversation again!

997
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:06,766
"The girl had dou..."

998
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:10,101
"...ble..."

999
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:13,769
"...double D-cups."

1000
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:16,244
There you go. You got it,
lil' man.

1001
00:45:16,313 --> 00:45:22,980
"I put my mouth
on her nip..."

1002
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,452
"...ples."

1003
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:25,681
What is that?

1004
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,624
What are you doing
letting him read th...

1005
00:45:28,692 --> 00:45:30,489
He read. You read.

1006
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,188
Georgey, you read.

1007
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:33,661
I'm gonna kill you!

1008
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,028
I am so proud of you.

1009
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:36,293
I'm turning you in!

1010
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:38,197
Pfft.
I found it in your drawer.

1011
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:42,136
Well, I am a grown man
of 54... 41... 49 years old,

1012
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:45,175
and he's 8, and what I read
in the privacy of my...

1013
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:46,334
How'd you do it?

1014
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,935
Oh, God,
I'm never gonna get this done.

1015
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:51,242
Look,
the boy don't look carefully

1016
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:52,873
at the details in a word,

1017
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:55,384
so most of the time,
he's just guessin'.

1018
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:57,215
What you got to do
is just slow it down

1019
00:45:57,287 --> 00:45:59,221
and give him somethin'
stimulatin' to read.

1020
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:00,984
Dad?

1021
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:02,184
What's a rack?

1022
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:03,283
It's a country.

1023
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:06,395
Well...

1024
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:09,955
I was just doin' it
'cause he was botherin' me.

1025
00:46:10,033 --> 00:46:11,125
Well, either way...

1027
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:13,826
Can you get rid of this?

1028
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:15,201
Just put it back in my room,

1029
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,399
'cause I'll get rid of it,
'cause I have a special...

1031
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:26,812
Well, Mrs. Kline,
how wonderful to see you.

1032
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:27,816
Come in!

1033
00:46:27,885 --> 00:46:29,648
It's girls poker night
at the house.

1034
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:30,812
Where's my little dealer?

1035
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:33,550
Well, just wait right here,
and I will just go get him.

1036
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,524
Georgey, Mrs. Kline is here!

1037
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:36,581
Hi, Mrs. Kline.

1038
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,423
Come on, Georgey!

1039
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:40,486
Tonight, I'm gonna
teach you to bluff.

1042
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:45,491
And I think we need to
comb your hair differently.

1043
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:47,002
You look like a fag.

1044
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:48,867
- I'm not a fag!
- I didn't say you were.

1045
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:50,566
- Hello.
- Hi. How are you?

1046
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,040
Oh, good evening, sir.

1047
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:54,304
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1048
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:57,575
Dad, I don't want you
to freak out, okay?

1049
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,639
Why would I freak out?

1050
00:46:59,716 --> 00:47:02,617
Well...

1051
00:47:02,686 --> 00:47:04,586
Dad, this is Aaron.

1052
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,350
Hi.

1053
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:07,856
- Hello.
- How do you do, sir?

1054
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:10,052
I-I-I'm so glad
to actually meet you.

1055
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:12,721
I-I-I told Sarah
that it was very important

1056
00:47:12,796 --> 00:47:14,559
that you feel comfortable
with me

1057
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:17,361
taking her to
my parents' for dinner.

1058
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:21,193
So, this is a date?

1059
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:26,867
Oh, um, I'll have her home
by 11:00 at the latest, sir?

1060
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,580
I guess that'd be all right.

1064
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:48,921
All right. Did it work?

1065
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:51,160
Yeah, like a charm, my friend.

1066
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:54,227
All right. Let's party.

1067
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:55,430
Hey, watch the seats.

1068
00:47:55,505 --> 00:47:56,836
- All right...
- Oh, shut up.

1069
00:47:56,907 --> 00:47:58,499
No, I'm serious.
It's leather.

1070
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:05,238
Hmm.

1071
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:13,521
Well, look at you,
all growed up.

1072
00:48:16,126 --> 00:48:18,185
There's nothing to eat
in the house.

1073
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:20,355
Yeah.
You comin' to a point?

1074
00:48:24,601 --> 00:48:26,694
Well, I'm hungry.
Are you?

1075
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:30,465
You askin' me out?

1076
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:33,134
Well, no, I'm not.

1077
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:36,872
Yes, I am.

1078
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:40,038
Okay.

1087
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:06,941
Oh, look at the legs
on this wine.

1088
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:09,672
I'm telling you,
this place is bangin'.

1089
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:12,078
Don't you just mean,
"This is nice"?

1090
00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:14,845
Why the word "bangin"'
make you so uptight?

1091
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:17,751
You're smart... if you'd just
deign to speak English

1092
00:49:17,821 --> 00:49:20,085
with what you learned
on the Internet and in prison,

1093
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:21,954
you could be
a paralegal tomorrow.

1094
00:49:22,025 --> 00:49:25,153
Like they gonna be beatin' down
my door to let me in school.

1095
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:27,594
You're exactly
the kind of person they want.

1096
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:30,155
Well, why would I want
to do that, anyway?

1097
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:31,723
I've been to your office.

1098
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,929
Everybody's all uptight,
overworked,

1099
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:36,370
tired, stressed-out,
don't see their family.

1100
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,374
"Ooh, Ed is comin'."
"Ooh, Tobias."

1101
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:40,410
I get a wedgie
just walking in your office.

1102
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,377
Hey, it's what people do.
They work.

1103
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:45,609
Look, all I'm sayin' is
I did the confinement thing

1104
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:46,876
for four years.

1105
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:49,077
If you're so concerned
with my future,

1106
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,915
just help me clear my name.

1107
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,512
I got it from there.

1108
00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:54,557
I got my own dreams,
my own goals.

1110
00:49:56,193 --> 00:49:57,455
Hey, give it to me.

1111
00:49:57,527 --> 00:49:59,188
Hey!
What'd you do that for?!

1112
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:01,457
- 'Cause you work too much.
- This is my phone!

1113
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:03,226
That's probably why your wife
left your sorry ass.

1114
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,598
Okay, Oprah, if you're so good
at relationships,

1115
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,466
how come you don't
have a boyfriend?

1116
00:50:07,537 --> 00:50:08,799
I had one.

1117
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:12,867
It's just I haven't seen
or heard from him

1118
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:14,570
since I went in
four years ago.

1119
00:50:15,645 --> 00:50:16,942
Were you in love with him?

1127
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:42,637
Come on, let's go dance.

1128
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:43,832
Ha ha ha ha... no.

1129
00:50:43,907 --> 00:50:46,967
Come on. When is
the last time you danced?

1130
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,511
At my wedding.

1131
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:51,672
Don't worry, I can dance.
It's just that I don't wanna.

1132
00:50:51,748 --> 00:50:54,114
Come on, smooth. Show me
what you're workin' with.

1133
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:56,015
I can dance.
I just don't want to dance.

1134
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:57,383
Man, you can't dance.

1135
00:50:57,454 --> 00:50:59,684
- Well, I got moves.
- Let me see.

1136
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:01,417
All right, all right.

1137
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:04,221
Okay, one last
little drink here.

1141
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:12,263
What, you got to pee?

1142
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:14,098
This was big in high school.

1143
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:16,696
Man, look, you can't dance
from your brain.

1144
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:18,365
You gotta feel it.
Now, come on.

1145
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:20,171
Show me how
you made them kids.

1148
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,113
- What the hell...
- How's this?

1149
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:27,207
That's great for an epileptic.
Come on, now.

1150
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:29,013
You gotta move your pelvis
with it.

1151
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:31,680
More hips.
There you go.

1152
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,416
Get smooth with it.

1154
00:51:37,127 --> 00:51:40,221
Well, I'm sorry.
I can't help it. I miss him.

1155
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:42,458
Oh, snap out of it, already.

1156
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:45,558
I'm snapped. I'm snappy.

1159
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:53,572
Oh, God, Ash.

1160
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:56,009
I still can't believe
you were hit by a car.

1161
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,980
Did you call a lawyer?

1162
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:01,483
Oh, I can't talk to a lawyer.
I was jaywalking.

1163
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:02,984
So, can we just stop...

1165
00:52:04,421 --> 00:52:06,184
- What?
- Oh, my God.

1168
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:11,254
What?

1172
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:17,865
Look at that!

1173
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:22,329
Oh, my God, it's true.
Look at that! Look at that!

1175
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,874
He never danced like that
with me.

1176
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:28,342
I'm gonna go talk to him.

1177
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:30,910
No! Sit!

1178
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,039
Why?

1179
00:52:33,116 --> 00:52:34,378
I can't tell you.

1180
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:35,850
If I talk about it,

1181
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:39,082
gangster people will come
to my house and cut me.

1182
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:43,625
Oh.

1184
00:52:45,128 --> 00:52:48,461
Oh, he almost looks
like a fun person.

1186
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:52,895
Must've been me.

1187
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:54,630
Was it me?

1188
00:52:54,704 --> 00:52:56,934
No. Stop beating yourself up.
It's him.

1189
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,975
Can we just
get out of here? Now?

1190
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:01,033
You know what they say...

1191
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:03,944
once you go black,
you never go back.

1193
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:08,046
Can we get the check, please?

1209
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:42,547
And that's why
I worked so hard,

1210
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:45,452
so I could give Kate a good
life, then it backfired!

1211
00:53:45,522 --> 00:53:47,649
Man, bitches don't care
nothin' about that shit.

1212
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:50,284
Oh, bitches do too care.

1213
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,987
I'm gonna
tell you a secret...

1214
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:54,929
sometimes I drive by our old
house, and I just look at it,

1215
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:57,432
and I just remember our life,
and it just hurts!

1216
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,525
Man, that is so pathetic,
P. Diddy.

1217
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:02,037
But you know what?
I'm gonna help you get her back.

1218
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:03,163
How?

1219
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,265
Well, first,
we gotta create a mood.

1221
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:10,271
Just like at
the restaurant, baby.

1222
00:54:10,347 --> 00:54:11,609
I'm already there.

1223
00:54:11,681 --> 00:54:13,672
Yeah.
Now, feel the Barry.

1224
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,344
Feel Barry White.
Talk like Barry.

1225
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:18,444
- Okay, that's Barry.
- Yeah.

1226
00:54:18,521 --> 00:54:19,545
This is Kate.

1227
00:54:19,623 --> 00:54:21,215
Hey, Kate. Yeah.

1228
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:23,225
I want you to talk nasty
to her!

1229
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:25,124
Talk nasty!

1230
00:54:25,195 --> 00:54:29,825
I'd like to kiss you a lot.

1231
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:31,696
Cut that sensitive shit,
Nancy Boy!

1232
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:32,700
What?

1233
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:34,464
- You gotta be a beast!
- A beast!

1234
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:35,469
Yeah!

1235
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:37,199
In the bedroom,
a woman wants a man

1236
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:39,208
that knows how to ride her
when she bucks.

1237
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,870
Ride 'em when she bucks!
Ride 'em!

1238
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:44,641
It's just... I can't.
It's a sculpture. I just can't.

1239
00:54:44,714 --> 00:54:46,545
All right, okay.

1240
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:47,878
Use me, then.

1241
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,052
Huh?

1242
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,315
Damn it, grab these.

1243
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:53,481
- What?!
- Grab 'em!

1244
00:54:53,556 --> 00:54:54,989
Ohh!

1246
00:54:57,827 --> 00:55:00,796
Oh, I get it, yeah.

1247
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:03,332
- Hey, Kate.
- Uh-huh.

1248
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,800
Yeah, you've been waitin'
for this for a while, huh?

1249
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:07,962
That's right. Now,
what you gonna do to her?

1250
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:10,029
I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do!

1251
00:55:10,106 --> 00:55:13,075
I'm gonna give you
an aromatherapy massage

1252
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,633
with incense!

1253
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:16,269
No! Come on, now!

1254
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:18,314
Wimps give
aromatherapy massages!

1255
00:55:18,381 --> 00:55:19,507
Tell her again!

1256
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:21,106
All right!

1257
00:55:21,184 --> 00:55:22,947
I'm gonna have...

1258
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:25,783
sexual intercourse, baby!

1259
00:55:25,855 --> 00:55:29,416
No, you... you a beast!
You need some of these.

1260
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:31,392
- Yeah.
- <i>Cojones grande!</i>

1261
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:34,191
Yeah! I'm gonna put 'em
in my pants!

1262
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:36,425
- Get in there, boys!
- Now, grab 'em!

1263
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:38,524
- Grab 'em. Yeah, hey, baby!
- Grab 'em!

1264
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:41,092
Now, what you gonna do?
What you gonna do?!

1265
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,571
Yeah, Mama! You gonna be
my tawdry little woman?

1266
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,870
Damn right!
Now get to humpin'!

1267
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:47,603
- Ya-hoo!
- Whoa!

1268
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:49,110
- How 'bout that, huh?!
- Yeah!

1269
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,272
How would you like me
to pounce on you

1270
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,908
- like a lion from above?
- I like it! I like it!

1271
00:55:53,983 --> 00:55:55,678
- Yo!
- That's what I'm talkin'!

1272
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:57,686
You ain't just
no king of the jungle,

1273
00:55:57,754 --> 00:55:59,051
you own that jungle!

1274
00:55:59,122 --> 00:56:00,612
That's your pride!

1275
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,419
You own that jungle,
and ain't no one

1276
00:56:02,492 --> 00:56:04,483
gonna come around
and mess with your pride!

1277
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:06,654
That's right!
I like that.

1278
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:09,221
Yeah! You ain't ready
for that shit! Come on, now!

1279
00:56:09,299 --> 00:56:11,927
Be a beast! What you gonna do
when she starts ridin', huh?

1280
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:13,798
Take care of her!
That's what I'm gonna do!

1281
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,963
- Uh-huh! Uh-huh!
- You're mine, Kate!

1282
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:18,064
- Ride that lighting rod!
- You don't need these no more.

1283
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:20,609
You got your own!
You found your balls!

1284
00:56:20,677 --> 00:56:23,441
Yeah, I don't need those balls!
I got my own balls!

1287
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:29,007
Mandingo!

1288
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:33,955
What goes on in your personal
life is none of our business,

1289
00:56:34,023 --> 00:56:35,513
but if it begins
to affect the firm,

1290
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:36,923
we need to call attention
to it.

1291
00:56:36,993 --> 00:56:39,052
Guys, we were moving a statue,

1292
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:41,597
and we lost our footing,
and we fell.

1293
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:43,291
My sister's
under the impression

1294
00:56:43,366 --> 00:56:45,698
that you were
humping your nanny.

1295
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:48,431
I was not humping my nanny!

1296
00:56:48,505 --> 00:56:52,271
Peter, surely you understand
that if Mrs. Arness

1297
00:56:52,342 --> 00:56:56,711
were to suspect any instability
on your part...

1298
00:56:56,780 --> 00:57:00,341
There is no instability
in my home.

1299
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:03,148
You sure
you can trust this guy?

1300
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:05,551
Well, hey,
he's helping me reopen my case.

1301
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:07,021
Y'all got any leads?

1302
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,957
Well, a still from
the bank surveillance camera

1303
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:11,186
is on its way here,

1304
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,855
and we found a deposition
that could help.

1305
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:15,295
Well, that's cool, baby.

1306
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:17,526
If there's anything
I can do to help,

1307
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,795
anything...
you just holler.

1308
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:22,737
I gotta run.

1309
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:26,503
Hey, Widow, if you meant
what you just said,

1310
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:28,544
it's not gonna be an easy job.

1311
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:31,102
I know it ain't.

1312
00:57:31,181 --> 00:57:33,615
I just gotta know
that if things get rough,

1313
00:57:33,683 --> 00:57:36,447
you're not gonna run out
on me.

1314
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:39,181
I've been waitin'
four years for this.

1315
00:57:39,255 --> 00:57:40,517
I ain't gonna mess up.

1319
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:09,674
Planning another heist?

1320
00:58:11,888 --> 00:58:14,049
No.
Why would you say that?

1321
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:15,556
I don't know.

1322
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:17,889
Maybe it was hearing
the words "job" and "hot"

1323
00:58:17,961 --> 00:58:20,327
bandied between
two tattooed people?

1324
00:58:20,396 --> 00:58:23,627
That was just my old boyfriend
I told you about... Widow.

1325
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:26,567
He's just tryin'
to get back with me.

1326
00:58:26,636 --> 00:58:28,069
Mm-hmm.

1327
00:58:28,137 --> 00:58:30,264
I'm tellin' you the truth!

1328
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,103
Look, I just didn't
want you to see him,

1329
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:36,475
because Widow, he ain't been
the best boyfriend,

1330
00:58:36,546 --> 00:58:39,242
and I knew
he'd be all over me.

1331
00:58:39,315 --> 00:58:41,875
Now you suddenly care
what I think?

1332
00:58:43,386 --> 00:58:44,375
No.

1333
00:58:45,822 --> 00:58:47,881
Maybe.

1334
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:50,550
A little bit.

1336
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,260
No more late visits?

1337
00:58:56,332 --> 00:58:57,765
Word.

1338
00:58:57,834 --> 00:58:59,233
Convicted felon's honor?

1339
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:02,135
Innocent convicted felon's
honor.

1340
00:59:04,073 --> 00:59:06,439
Now, give me some dap,
right there on the edge.

1341
00:59:06,509 --> 00:59:08,136
Right there, and then
come up here like that.

1342
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,610
Pow, like that.

1343
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:10,611
Hello?

1344
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:11,647
Dad!

1345
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:12,772
Hey, sweetie.

1346
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:14,282
Is Charlene there?

1347
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:16,614
Yeah, she's here.
Do you want to talk to her?

1348
00:59:16,686 --> 00:59:18,153
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm...

1349
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:19,279
All right.

1350
00:59:19,355 --> 00:59:21,755
- Sarah? Okay.
- Girl talk.

1351
00:59:21,824 --> 00:59:23,314
What up, dog?

1352
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:26,851
I need you to come pick me up.
I can't talk about it right now.

1353
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:27,794
Where you at?

1354
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:30,424
I'm on the corner
of Venice and Canal,

1355
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,764
and there's a whole lot
of people out front.

1356
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:35,099
- Please don't tell my dad!
- All right.

1357
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:37,605
No, just calm down.
I'm comin' to get you.

1361
00:59:57,393 --> 00:59:59,327
I'm sorry.
I didn't know who else to call.

1362
00:59:59,395 --> 01:00:00,623
It's cool.
What's goin' on?

1363
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:04,497
Hey, Sarah, what have
you been up to? Hee hee!

1364
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:05,898
Is that your boyfriend?

1365
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:08,130
No, he's not my boyfriend.

1366
01:00:08,204 --> 01:00:10,502
I liked his friend, Mike,

1367
01:00:10,573 --> 01:00:13,508
and we hung out a few times,
and he was always really nice,

1368
01:00:13,576 --> 01:00:16,374
but then... all he wanted to
do tonight was have sex,

1369
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,471
I mean, he moved in
kind of rough, and...

1370
01:00:18,548 --> 01:00:20,539
He got rough with you?
Where he at?

1371
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:22,551
He went back there
with that group.

1372
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,382
Go wait downstairs.

1373
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:25,978
Yo, Mike!

1374
01:00:26,055 --> 01:00:28,353
Please, don't kill me!

1375
01:00:28,424 --> 01:00:29,482
Oh, God!

1376
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:31,754
What are you? Crazy?!

1377
01:00:31,828 --> 01:00:33,887
Pull me up!
What do you want?!

1378
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:34,895
Sarah!

1379
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:37,489
Mike has somethin'
to say to you.

1380
01:00:37,567 --> 01:00:38,659
Say "sorry"!

1381
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:43,365
I-I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
God, I am sorry!

1382
01:00:43,439 --> 01:00:44,497
Say "No means no."

1383
01:00:44,574 --> 01:00:45,598
No means no!

1385
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:49,536
She was where?!

1386
01:00:49,612 --> 01:00:51,170
Calm down. It's just...

1387
01:00:51,247 --> 01:00:53,181
- She is 14!
- She's 15! Wait!

1388
01:00:53,249 --> 01:00:54,546
G... well... oh!

1389
01:00:54,617 --> 01:00:56,141
Look...

1390
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:58,050
Sarah don't need a warden.

1391
01:00:58,121 --> 01:01:00,919
She needs her father...
you...

1392
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,617
so you can't get mad,
all right?

1393
01:01:02,692 --> 01:01:05,024
You do it, she'll never
tell you anything again.

1394
01:01:07,597 --> 01:01:09,861
All right.
I get it. I get it.

1395
01:01:09,932 --> 01:01:13,595
Just be cool. Just play it cool,
you know what I mean?

1396
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,797
Just listen to her.
Let her do the talkin'.

1397
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:18,465
I am listening to you!

1398
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:19,872
Thank you.

1400
01:01:22,078 --> 01:01:24,069
Don't trip.

1401
01:01:25,448 --> 01:01:27,348
Don't trip.

1403
01:01:33,623 --> 01:01:37,081
So...

1404
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,821
you went out with a boy...

1405
01:01:38,895 --> 01:01:42,456
and he took you to a party,

1406
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:45,660
where kids were... drinking

1407
01:01:45,735 --> 01:01:50,798
and "trippin' on E."...

1408
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:54,707
and then he took you
up to a room

1409
01:01:54,777 --> 01:01:56,677
where he tried to...

1410
01:01:56,746 --> 01:02:00,876
"get all up in that..."

1411
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:03,510
which he... didn't?

1412
01:02:08,858 --> 01:02:11,258
And then Charlene came...

1413
01:02:11,327 --> 01:02:15,263
in my new car...
and brought you home

1414
01:02:15,364 --> 01:02:19,198
after first...
"bitchslapping" him.

1415
01:02:24,607 --> 01:02:26,507
Well...

1416
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:32,477
...that was some night.

1418
01:02:34,517 --> 01:02:35,541
Oh, Dad!

1420
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:39,219
I can't believe
you're not killing me!

1421
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:42,485
Oh! This is so great! I want
everything out in the open!

1422
01:02:42,558 --> 01:02:46,016
Oh, I have so much more
to tell you!

1429
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:21,814
Kate, what are you doing here?

1430
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:24,121
W-What are you doing here?

1431
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:25,660
It's my shortcut home
from work.

1432
01:04:25,728 --> 01:04:26,990
No, it's not.

1433
01:04:27,063 --> 01:04:28,553
- Yes, it is.
- Is not.

1434
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:31,225
I thought you were
in the mountains.

1435
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:35,065
Well, yeah,
I-I came back early.

1436
01:04:35,137 --> 01:04:38,368
There were bears that were
mauling the campers

1437
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:40,102
and eating them.

1438
01:04:42,178 --> 01:04:43,270
Wow.

1439
01:04:43,346 --> 01:04:46,440
But other than that...
nothing went wrong with your...

1440
01:04:46,515 --> 01:04:47,846
Oh, no, no.
He's great.

1441
01:04:47,917 --> 01:04:49,407
Yeah, I liked him.

1442
01:04:51,754 --> 01:04:54,245
So, how's your...

1443
01:04:54,323 --> 01:04:56,086
My what?

1444
01:04:56,158 --> 01:04:57,716
Your life?

1445
01:04:57,793 --> 01:05:00,523
Anything hip and new?

1446
01:05:00,596 --> 01:05:02,154
No.

1447
01:05:04,667 --> 01:05:06,191
Um...

1448
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:07,759
I'm having a good time
with the kids.

1449
01:05:07,837 --> 01:05:09,429
Good. Glad you're having
fun with her.

1450
01:05:10,273 --> 01:05:11,604
Them.

1451
01:05:16,946 --> 01:05:18,345
What?

1452
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:20,905
You look, um...

1453
01:05:20,983 --> 01:05:21,972
Yeah.

1454
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:23,143
Rested.

1456
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:26,713
Nice. You look nice.

1457
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:30,156
So, um, I guess I'll come by
later and pick up the kids.

1458
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:33,457
Oh, I was wondering if I could
keep them through Friday.

1459
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:36,862
Really?
You're not too busy?

1460
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,332
No.

1461
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:43,104
Well, yes, it's okay.

1462
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:45,538
It's wonderful, Peter.

1463
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:47,599
You know, if you wanted
to come ov...

1466
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:55,913
Go ahead.

1467
01:05:55,985 --> 01:05:57,316
Sorry.

1468
01:06:00,923 --> 01:06:02,185
Hello?

1469
01:06:02,258 --> 01:06:04,055
Yo, get your butt home, dog.

1470
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:06,321
I will be home in my own
sweet time, girlfriend.

1471
01:06:06,395 --> 01:06:09,228
You gotta come now. Arness said
she on her way over here.

1472
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:11,823
Oh, I forgot all about that.

1473
01:06:11,901 --> 01:06:14,665
Oh, I'm sorry.
I-I have to go.

1474
01:06:14,737 --> 01:06:16,136
I just forgot
about something,

1475
01:06:16,205 --> 01:06:18,571
but I want to continue
this conversation,

1476
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:21,735
so I will call you, or you can
call me on my cell.

1477
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:22,869
Bye!

1478
01:06:22,945 --> 01:06:23,877
Uh-huh.

1484
01:06:55,077 --> 01:06:56,874
- Is she here yet?
- No!

1485
01:06:56,946 --> 01:06:58,538
The place is a mess!

1487
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:01,780
e gotta clean this place up!

1488
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:03,842
Hey, get upstairs
and get ready!

1489
01:07:03,919 --> 01:07:05,386
And what are you reading?!

1490
01:07:05,454 --> 01:07:07,479
Get up there!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1491
01:07:07,556 --> 01:07:09,524
Hey, yo, P.,
while we got this minute...

1492
01:07:09,592 --> 01:07:11,890
there's somethin' I really
been meanin' to tell you...

1493
01:07:11,961 --> 01:07:13,553
Well, you'll have to wait.

1495
01:07:25,341 --> 01:07:27,070
Kids! She's here!

1496
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:36,280
Mrs. Arness?

1497
01:07:36,352 --> 01:07:37,182
Oh!

1498
01:07:37,253 --> 01:07:41,155
I'll get right to the point,
Mr. Sanderson.

1499
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:43,418
There are rumors circulating

1500
01:07:43,492 --> 01:07:48,759
that your personal life
and your home are in disarray,

1501
01:07:48,831 --> 01:07:51,527
and this makes me feel
very unsettled.

1502
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,795
I don't know who misinformed
you, but please, come in.

1503
01:07:53,869 --> 01:07:55,928
I'd hate to think you're
under any misapprehension

1504
01:07:56,005 --> 01:07:57,597
about me or my family.

1506
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:00,808
Sarah? Georgey?

1507
01:08:00,876 --> 01:08:04,175
You remember Mrs. Arness?

1508
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:07,113
So lovely to see you again.

1509
01:08:07,183 --> 01:08:09,014
Um, Father,
when you have a moment,

1510
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:12,885
would you mind helping me with
my report on Queen Victoria?

1511
01:08:12,955 --> 01:08:14,616
Sure, kitten.

1512
01:08:15,691 --> 01:08:18,524
And don't forget, Pop, tomorrow
you have to come to school

1513
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:20,789
and help hand out the food
to the poor kids.

1514
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:23,730
Have I ever forgotten
to help the poor kids?

1515
01:08:23,799 --> 01:08:25,596
No, Pop. Never.

1516
01:08:28,404 --> 01:08:32,738
In truth, Mr. Sanderson,
you have a lovely home.

1517
01:08:32,808 --> 01:08:33,866
Thank you.

1518
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:36,138
And your children
are very well-behaved.

1519
01:08:36,212 --> 01:08:38,077
They're angels.

1520
01:08:38,147 --> 01:08:39,978
Oh, William.

1521
01:08:40,049 --> 01:08:41,175
Oh, look!

1522
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:42,911
He's even taken a fancy
to your boy.

1523
01:08:42,985 --> 01:08:44,316
That's so sweet.

1524
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:46,718
Anyway, we can go to the den
and get the contracts...

1525
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:48,780
What is that heavenly smell?

1526
01:08:48,858 --> 01:08:51,656
Ah, that would be
Charlene preparing dinner.

1527
01:08:51,727 --> 01:08:53,558
Anyway, the contracts...

1528
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:56,962
I haven't smelled home cooking
like that since I was a child.

1529
01:08:57,032 --> 01:08:58,590
Really? Anyway...

1530
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:00,692
Brings back
such happy memories.

1531
01:09:00,769 --> 01:09:04,227
Does it? Anyway, actually,
the den is closer...

1532
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:06,900
Your table looks so inviting.

1533
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:10,571
Yes. It's too bad
it's so small.

1534
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:12,045
Small?

1535
01:09:12,114 --> 01:09:14,605
Well, actually,
it's big, isn't it?

1536
01:09:14,683 --> 01:09:16,378
It's a big table, so...

1537
01:09:16,452 --> 01:09:18,682
there would be room
for one more.

1538
01:09:18,754 --> 01:09:21,518
Oh, well, if it's not
an imposition...

1539
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:22,887
Oh... oh.

1540
01:09:22,958 --> 01:09:25,518
Well, let me just go check
if there's enough food.

1541
01:09:25,594 --> 01:09:27,027
I'm not... I'm not sure,

1542
01:09:27,096 --> 01:09:29,087
because, uh, actually,
this is the night of, uh,

1543
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:32,862
Yiminum, the, uh...
the holiday where

1544
01:09:32,935 --> 01:09:34,766
white people eat
very little portions

1545
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:36,930
because that was the night
the Lord came down,

1546
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:38,166
and he was given food,

1547
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,470
and there was just too much,
and he said, "No."

1548
01:09:40,543 --> 01:09:42,511
And so, he had
a smaller portion,

1549
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:44,739
and that's why we might not
have enough.

1550
01:09:44,813 --> 01:09:47,782
So, I'll just go check on, uh,
what the Lord would say.

1551
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:50,216
Just one second.

1552
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:51,548
Come here, William.

1553
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:53,884
Hey, come here.
Are you hungry?

1554
01:09:56,625 --> 01:09:57,785
Charlene...

1555
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:00,192
If there was ever a time
I needed a favor, it's now.

1556
01:10:00,262 --> 01:10:01,593
You got it, baby.
Anything.

1557
01:10:01,664 --> 01:10:03,097
Oh, thank you!

1560
01:10:13,676 --> 01:10:15,200
Oh. Mrs. Arness?

1561
01:10:15,277 --> 01:10:17,142
Yes? Oh, yes.

1563
01:10:18,447 --> 01:10:21,177
My family and I are pleased
to invite you for dinner.

1564
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:22,308
Yeah, oh.

1565
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:24,443
Well, very well.
I wasn't expecting this.

1566
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:26,010
Uh, but if you insist.

1567
01:10:26,088 --> 01:10:28,648
And then afterwards,
we can sign the contracts.

1568
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:29,520
Of course.

1569
01:10:29,592 --> 01:10:31,457
Dinner is served.

1570
01:10:32,928 --> 01:10:35,795
I was raised
in the South, you know.

1571
01:10:35,864 --> 01:10:39,265
That smells just like
our Ivy's jambalaya.

1572
01:10:39,335 --> 01:10:42,600
She was so wonderful.

1573
01:10:42,671 --> 01:10:45,367
We paid her nothing,
of course, you know.

1574
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:48,501
But, then, people had standards
of service in those days.

1575
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:51,444
And, of course, Ivy did know

1576
01:10:51,513 --> 01:10:56,541
that you serve from the left
and collect from the right.

1577
01:10:59,722 --> 01:11:00,780
Don't...

1578
01:11:00,856 --> 01:11:03,882
stop at that story, because
I love hearing about your past.

1579
01:11:03,959 --> 01:11:05,290
That is fascinating.

1581
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:09,120
Oh, yes.

1582
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:11,166
Well, anyway,
as I was saying...

1584
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:16,128
Yeah.

1585
01:11:16,205 --> 01:11:18,435
Yeah. Fast-actin'.

1586
01:11:18,507 --> 01:11:20,202
Fast-actin'.

1588
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:23,737
Ooh, I'm gonna get you.

1589
01:11:23,812 --> 01:11:25,746
I'm gonna get you.

1590
01:11:25,814 --> 01:11:28,146
Uh-huh.
I'll serve your food right.

1591
01:11:28,217 --> 01:11:30,151
Was it the left?
Was it the right?

1592
01:11:30,219 --> 01:11:33,814
Father's work with the
Pasadena Republican Youth Group

1593
01:11:33,889 --> 01:11:36,016
has truly been invaluable.

1594
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:39,356
I hope y'all brought
y'all appetites.

1595
01:11:39,428 --> 01:11:41,055
Oh, yes.

1596
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:43,826
I brought mine.

1597
01:11:43,899 --> 01:11:45,127
Oh, my goodness.

1598
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,100
This is much too much for me.

1599
01:11:47,169 --> 01:11:49,228
I'll never get through
all that.

1600
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:51,364
I have a little less here.
I'll trade with you.

1601
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:52,429
Oh.

1602
01:11:54,743 --> 01:11:57,041
Thank you.

1603
01:11:59,281 --> 01:12:00,179
What, Charlene?

1605
01:12:02,117 --> 01:12:03,175
Nothing, sir.

1606
01:12:03,252 --> 01:12:05,345
Oh.

1607
01:12:06,922 --> 01:12:08,253
Oh, this food
is so delicious.

1608
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:09,382
Serves him right, anyway,

1609
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:11,551
makin' me wear
this stinkin' outfit.

1610
01:12:11,627 --> 01:12:13,788
You're very lucky to have found
such talented help.

1612
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:19,861
Well, our Ivy was with us
for so long,

1613
01:12:19,935 --> 01:12:22,199
we really thought of her
as one of the family.

1614
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:23,203
Mmm.

1615
01:12:23,272 --> 01:12:24,637
And after every meal,

1616
01:12:24,707 --> 01:12:28,268
my mother would scrape
all the food we hadn't eaten

1617
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:31,575
and put it on one big plate
and give it to Ivy.

1619
01:12:40,622 --> 01:12:41,953
Charlene...

1620
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:44,959
what is that
particular taste?

1621
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:46,995
It's familiar, yet...

1622
01:12:47,062 --> 01:12:51,328
Is it some kind of herb
like sage?

1623
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:54,096
No, it's sort of more
like a milk of mint.

1624
01:12:54,169 --> 01:12:57,696
Milk of... whatever it is,
the taste is explosive.

1625
01:12:57,773 --> 01:12:58,762
Mmm.

1626
01:12:58,841 --> 01:13:01,036
Well, good, then.

1627
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:03,237
Enjoy.

1628
01:13:03,312 --> 01:13:05,075
Oh, just one moment.

1629
01:13:05,147 --> 01:13:06,705
Uh, you know, uh,

1630
01:13:06,782 --> 01:13:10,240
there's a lovely,
sad Negro spiritual...

1632
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:14,352
...that Ivy's brother used...

1633
01:13:14,423 --> 01:13:15,617
Are you all right?

1634
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:20,123
Anyway, Ivy's brother
used to sing this

1635
01:13:20,195 --> 01:13:24,029
when he came in
from the tobacco fields.

1652
01:14:06,742 --> 01:14:08,972
Now, there's a second verse

1653
01:14:09,044 --> 01:14:11,478
if you'd like to join
in the chorus.

1664
01:14:38,507 --> 01:14:39,667
Dad?

1665
01:14:39,741 --> 01:14:41,106
Are you okay?

1676
01:14:54,723 --> 01:14:56,918
I hope your father's
all right.

1677
01:14:56,992 --> 01:14:58,254
Does this happen often?

1678
01:14:58,327 --> 01:15:00,761
Well, if you'll excuse us.

1679
01:15:00,829 --> 01:15:02,126
Um...

1680
01:15:02,197 --> 01:15:05,257
Georgey, let's go watch that
biography on Francis Drake.

1682
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:09,932
We... I mean,

1683
01:15:10,005 --> 01:15:13,736
he seemed to be
so moved by that song.

1684
01:15:13,809 --> 01:15:16,403
Oh, he movin', all right.

1687
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:20,942
- And tonight's top story...
- William?

1688
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:22,313
The FBI needs your help

1689
01:15:22,384 --> 01:15:24,784
in finding fugitive at large
Charlene Morton.

1690
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:27,481
Charlene is an African-American
female, 31 years of age...

1692
01:15:28,991 --> 01:15:30,083
What is it?

1693
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:31,853
...and 5'6", 175 pounds,

1694
01:15:31,927 --> 01:15:33,895
with a tattoo
on her left breast.

1695
01:15:33,962 --> 01:15:35,395
Convicted of armed robbery,

1696
01:15:35,464 --> 01:15:37,989
Charlene is considered
cunning and highly dangerous.

1698
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:41,833
Having escaped from the Women's
Correctional Facility

1699
01:15:41,904 --> 01:15:43,838
outside Los Angeles
a mere six days ago,

1700
01:15:43,906 --> 01:15:45,840
Morton is suspected
to be armed.

1701
01:15:45,908 --> 01:15:49,400
This bank surveillance tape
shows Charlene wielding a gun

1702
01:15:49,478 --> 01:15:51,810
and holding a customer hostage.

1703
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:55,714
Charlene is considered dangerous
and may be armed.

1704
01:15:55,784 --> 01:15:58,912
If you have any information
concerning Charlene Morton,

1705
01:15:58,987 --> 01:16:01,979
please contact
your local FBI office.

1706
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:05,322
That's it for tonight's edition
of "Criminals at Large."

1707
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:08,090
Good night and be safe.

1708
01:16:08,163 --> 01:16:10,927
Mrs. Arness,
I can explain everything.

1709
01:16:17,072 --> 01:16:19,666
Pete, before you lose it,
just let me explain.

1710
01:16:19,741 --> 01:16:21,003
There's nothing to say.

1711
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:22,475
But I didn't do it, Pete.

1712
01:16:22,544 --> 01:16:23,806
You have to get out.

1715
01:16:28,617 --> 01:16:30,642
All right.
I'll get my stuff.

1717
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:56,270
I don't understand.
You saw her and where is she?

1718
01:16:56,345 --> 01:16:57,972
I don't know where she is.

1719
01:16:58,046 --> 01:17:00,708
Don't drop the soap.

1720
01:17:02,384 --> 01:17:03,612
What the hell does that mean?

1721
01:17:03,685 --> 01:17:05,846
I just don't believe this.
I'm worried about her.

1722
01:17:05,921 --> 01:17:07,980
I hate the fact that
she's out there all alone.

1723
01:17:08,056 --> 01:17:10,422
You're worried about the poor,
innocent, frail creature

1724
01:17:10,492 --> 01:17:12,687
who can hardly take care
of herself on the street?

1725
01:17:12,761 --> 01:17:14,786
What about me?
Tobias is gonna fire me!

1726
01:17:14,863 --> 01:17:15,887
And another goody...

1727
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:18,262
if Arness calls the cops,
I could go to jail!

1728
01:17:18,333 --> 01:17:20,426
Here's the local number
for the Bureau.

1729
01:17:20,502 --> 01:17:23,369
The FBI takes harboring
a fugitive very seriously.

1730
01:17:23,438 --> 01:17:27,169
You, gentlemen, will be
the first to hear from me.

1731
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:30,878
Arness didn't call the cops,
she called the FBI.

1732
01:17:30,946 --> 01:17:32,709
- Now, you haven't seen me.
- I have seen you.

1733
01:17:32,781 --> 01:17:34,180
No, I mean,
you <i>haven't</i> seen me.

1734
01:17:34,249 --> 01:17:36,149
I'm looking right at you.
What are you...

1735
01:17:38,253 --> 01:17:39,686
If you do hear from her,

1736
01:17:39,755 --> 01:17:43,657
please tell her the cool points
are out the window and...

1737
01:17:43,725 --> 01:17:46,057
she's got me all twisted up
in the game.

1741
01:17:58,674 --> 01:17:59,971
Why you messin' with Lene?

1742
01:18:00,042 --> 01:18:02,067
I'm not messing with her,
I'm helping her.

1743
01:18:02,144 --> 01:18:03,076
Bullshit!

1745
01:18:04,613 --> 01:18:06,410
Uh! I'm telling you
the truth!

1746
01:18:06,481 --> 01:18:08,881
Listen up.
You do not reopen this case.

1747
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:11,214
From now on,
I'm handlin' it for her.

1748
01:18:11,286 --> 01:18:13,550
I'm not gonna reopen the case.
The case is closed.

1749
01:18:13,622 --> 01:18:14,782
Stay out of her life.

1750
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:19,585
If I got to come back here,
things are gonna get bloody.

1752
01:18:21,730 --> 01:18:24,631
Maybe I should
just finish this now.

1755
01:18:35,977 --> 01:18:37,774
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1756
01:18:37,846 --> 01:18:39,279
We have to find Charlene.

1757
01:18:39,347 --> 01:18:41,144
I thought you hated Charlene.

1758
01:18:41,216 --> 01:18:42,615
I found out she's innocent.

1759
01:18:42,684 --> 01:18:44,652
I knew it. I knew it.

1760
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:45,846
Where am I gonna find her?

1761
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:48,116
Well, you can call her.

1762
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:50,852
How can I call her
if I don't know where she is?

1764
01:18:52,494 --> 01:18:55,861
I gave her your phone,
in case you might...

1765
01:18:55,931 --> 01:18:58,422
You gave her my new
$600 titanium cellphone?

1766
01:19:00,035 --> 01:19:01,525
Good idea. Come on.

1767
01:19:01,603 --> 01:19:03,867
W-What happened to your head?

1772
01:19:18,553 --> 01:19:21,454
Metropolitan Museum of Art.
How may I help you?

1773
01:19:21,523 --> 01:19:22,683
I know who set you up.

1774
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:24,055
What?! Who?

1776
01:19:30,232 --> 01:19:31,392
Get in.

1777
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:36,995
So, what's up?

1778
01:19:37,072 --> 01:19:38,505
The guy points a gun to my head

1779
01:19:38,573 --> 01:19:40,006
and tells me
not to reopen the case.

1780
01:19:40,075 --> 01:19:41,508
I'm thinking,
"Why is he doing this?"

1781
01:19:41,576 --> 01:19:44,807
And then it dawns on me...
it's because he was involved.

1782
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,142
God damn him.

1783
01:19:46,214 --> 01:19:49,650
I can't believe
Widow did this to me.

1784
01:19:49,718 --> 01:19:51,049
Where do you think he is?

1785
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:52,347
I don't know.

1786
01:19:54,422 --> 01:19:56,890
Probably downtown
at this club he hang out at

1787
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:58,789
called the Down Low.

1788
01:19:58,860 --> 01:20:00,418
Got to get a confession.

1789
01:20:00,495 --> 01:20:03,123
You can't go there.

1790
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:04,790
Eh, man, I'm serious.

1791
01:20:04,866 --> 01:20:06,834
A white man at the Down Low

1792
01:20:06,902 --> 01:20:10,099
is either a cop, a corpse,
or a crackhead.

1793
01:20:10,172 --> 01:20:12,037
You can't even talk 'hood.

1794
01:20:12,107 --> 01:20:13,938
I'll figure out something.

1795
01:20:14,009 --> 01:20:15,977
Oh, and Howie told me
to tell you

1796
01:20:16,044 --> 01:20:18,979
that "The cool points
are out the window,

1797
01:20:19,047 --> 01:20:22,210
and you got him
all twisted up in the game."

1798
01:20:23,852 --> 01:20:25,251
Really?

1799
01:20:26,621 --> 01:20:30,079
That's the nicest thing
anybody's ever said to me.

1800
01:20:32,594 --> 01:20:33,856
I'm gonna drop you off here

1801
01:20:33,929 --> 01:20:36,557
because I got to get to the
office for a conference call.

1802
01:20:36,631 --> 01:20:38,292
So, I'll see you
in a little bit.

1803
01:20:38,366 --> 01:20:40,357
All right. Okay, cool.

1805
01:20:47,275 --> 01:20:50,108
Yeah, freak boy,
I need a ride.

1806
01:20:50,178 --> 01:20:51,372
Can you come now?

1807
01:20:54,449 --> 01:20:57,509
Damn.
A straight, cold pimp.

1808
01:20:57,586 --> 01:21:00,146
Looks like Gendler
beat us to her.

1809
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:05,186
I can assure you, Mrs. Arness,

1810
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:07,660
Peter Sanderson
is no longer affiliated

1811
01:21:07,729 --> 01:21:09,629
with Tobias, Kline, and Barnes.

1812
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:10,756
Good.

1813
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,490
You have great ankles.

1814
01:21:13,568 --> 01:21:14,967
What?!

1815
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:17,004
Were you a dancer?

1816
01:21:19,074 --> 01:21:22,339
Yeah... well, yes.
I was.

1817
01:21:23,345 --> 01:21:24,676
I bet you had great presence.

1819
01:21:28,149 --> 01:21:30,947
Oh. How you two doin'?

1820
01:21:31,019 --> 01:21:33,180
I hope I'm not interruptin'
anything.

1821
01:21:33,255 --> 01:21:34,415
You're nasty.

1822
01:21:35,657 --> 01:21:37,181
W-What are you doing here?

1823
01:21:37,259 --> 01:21:40,092
Please, Mrs. Arness, I'm not
here to cause any trouble.

1824
01:21:40,161 --> 01:21:42,026
Well, that would be a first.

1825
01:21:42,097 --> 01:21:43,587
Julia? Julia?

1826
01:21:43,665 --> 01:21:46,293
Julia a little tied up
right now.

1827
01:21:46,368 --> 01:21:47,995
I just need you
to hear me out.

1828
01:21:48,069 --> 01:21:51,232
Peter is not responsible
for any of this. I am.

1829
01:21:51,306 --> 01:21:53,240
I mean,
the guy is a great lawyer.

1830
01:21:53,308 --> 01:21:56,277
And he's one of the most
decent men I've ever known.

1831
01:21:56,344 --> 01:21:57,777
- I doubt that's saying much.
- Shut up, fool.

1832
01:21:57,846 --> 01:22:01,077
If only you knew the lengths
he's willing to go to

1833
01:22:01,149 --> 01:22:02,411
to help a friend.

1834
01:22:02,484 --> 01:22:04,611
Listen... sister...

1835
01:22:04,686 --> 01:22:06,483
"Sister"?

1836
01:22:06,554 --> 01:22:08,681
Why don't you go back
to Sanderson,

1837
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:11,487
and the "Jungle Fever" thing
the two of you got goin' on,

1838
01:22:11,559 --> 01:22:13,390
before I call the cops?

1839
01:22:13,461 --> 01:22:14,985
That's it, pretty boy.

1840
01:22:15,063 --> 01:22:16,621
You ever met the big hurt?

1841
01:22:16,698 --> 01:22:18,563
The who?

1844
01:22:22,437 --> 01:22:23,995
I wouldn't do that
if I were you!

1845
01:22:24,072 --> 01:22:25,403
And why not?

1846
01:22:25,473 --> 01:22:27,839
You'll be instantly returned
to prison, where you belong.

1847
01:22:27,909 --> 01:22:29,001
All right. That's it.

1848
01:22:29,077 --> 01:22:30,669
How dare you!

1849
01:22:30,745 --> 01:22:32,110
To hell
with what I just said.

1850
01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:33,875
You obviously
one of them hard learners.

1851
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:34,881
Howie?

1852
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:38,078
This is my house! I will not
be told to do what I...

1854
01:22:41,222 --> 01:22:42,314
William.

1856
01:22:49,097 --> 01:22:51,588
I'm Kate Sanderson.
Have you seen my kids?

1857
01:22:51,666 --> 01:22:52,894
- Over there.
- Oh!

1858
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:53,900
Hey!

1859
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:55,163
Oh, God!

1860
01:22:55,236 --> 01:22:57,397
What is going on?

1861
01:22:57,472 --> 01:22:58,962
It's just the FBI, Mom.

1862
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:01,474
Yeah, they're just doing
a, like, search.

1863
01:23:01,543 --> 01:23:02,601
For what?

1864
01:23:02,677 --> 01:23:04,611
Well, for Charlene.
But she's not...

1865
01:23:04,679 --> 01:23:06,544
The FBI is looking
for your nanny?

1868
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:23,593
Man, take your hands off me!

1869
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:25,257
I said, back off me, punk!

1870
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:27,767
That's what I mean.
You know what I'm sayin'?

1871
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:29,770
You don't want
none of this, now.

1872
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:36,538
Excuse me...

1873
01:23:36,611 --> 01:23:37,805
Homeboys...

1883
01:23:59,834 --> 01:24:03,634
Say, yo.
You got a bathroom in there?

1889
01:24:14,916 --> 01:24:16,508
Say, yo, what's the dealio?

1890
01:24:17,519 --> 01:24:20,181
Mmm. Who's your daddy?

1891
01:24:21,089 --> 01:24:24,320
Back that booty up
and put it on the glass.

1892
01:24:24,392 --> 01:24:26,451
Anybody here
dig what I'm sayin'?

1895
01:24:30,432 --> 01:24:32,662
So...

1896
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:37,364
your nanny was doing time...

1897
01:24:37,439 --> 01:24:39,839
for armed robbery.

1898
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:44,637
And then she broke out
of prison...

1899
01:24:46,548 --> 01:24:49,813
...and then she came here.

1900
01:24:52,887 --> 01:24:55,185
But she's innocent...

1901
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:58,919
and now your dad
has gone off to...

1902
01:24:58,993 --> 01:25:00,688
help her.

1903
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:04,125
Sounds crazy, right?

1904
01:25:04,199 --> 01:25:06,030
He's not the same guy anymore.

1906
01:25:07,402 --> 01:25:08,699
Yeah, he's really cool.

1908
01:25:10,772 --> 01:25:13,673
Say, any of you homies
holdin' extra Jimmy High?

1909
01:25:13,741 --> 01:25:17,905
'Cause I'm all about crunchin'
some of that <i>boofanny</i> tonight.

1910
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:22,716
If you harm one hair
on that dog's head...

1911
01:25:22,784 --> 01:25:25,378
Yeah, "Harm a hair on the head."
You got me all nervous.

1912
01:25:25,453 --> 01:25:26,545
Hello?

1913
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:28,145
- Sarah?
- Oh, hey, Charlene.

1914
01:25:28,823 --> 01:25:29,847
Put your daddy on the phone.

1915
01:25:29,924 --> 01:25:32,415
No, he's not here.
He went out to find you.

1916
01:25:32,494 --> 01:25:33,859
He went to find me?!

1917
01:25:33,928 --> 01:25:35,020
Tsk. All right.

1919
01:25:36,498 --> 01:25:38,398
Howie, flip a "U."
We headed downtown.

1920
01:25:38,466 --> 01:25:40,093
Downtown's where I live,
precious.

1921
01:25:40,168 --> 01:25:41,601
No! No!

1922
01:25:41,669 --> 01:25:42,829
Whoa!

1924
01:25:44,172 --> 01:25:45,730
What's on your mind, player?

1925
01:25:45,807 --> 01:25:48,435
What's with you? You been
drinkin' some "Hatorade"?

1926
01:25:48,510 --> 01:25:50,637
What's up, Flavor?
Where you from?

1927
01:25:50,712 --> 01:25:53,340
From the 'hood
and misunderstood.

1928
01:25:54,849 --> 01:25:57,181
- How's your pimp hand, dog?
- Strong, baby, strong.

1931
01:26:00,522 --> 01:26:01,716
Can you swerve, snowman?

1932
01:26:01,789 --> 01:26:03,814
Do I got "honky"
spray-painted on my forehead?

1933
01:26:03,892 --> 01:26:05,883
Of course I can.
I'm tryin' to peep a bowwow.

1934
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:08,121
If you so at home, man,
then dance with the woman.

1935
01:26:08,196 --> 01:26:09,322
I can't. I got b'ness.

1936
01:26:09,397 --> 01:26:11,160
Go on out there
and get your groove on.

1937
01:26:11,232 --> 01:26:13,496
No, I can't. I got important
b'ness to take care of.

1938
01:26:13,568 --> 01:26:14,660
Yeah.

1941
01:26:19,274 --> 01:26:20,605
I tell you, but...

1951
01:27:44,959 --> 01:27:46,950
You'll get a life sentence
for this.

1952
01:27:47,028 --> 01:27:48,825
You're a kidnapper
and a whore!

1953
01:27:48,896 --> 01:27:51,194
Hey.
Keep talkin', tea bag.

1954
01:27:51,266 --> 01:27:52,824
Ooh?! Tea bag!

1955
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:54,868
Yeah, you'll be gummin'
your bubbles.

1956
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:56,494
Yeah, oh! Terrible.

1962
01:28:35,009 --> 01:28:38,501
Damn, boy, you lookin'
all kind of stupid.

1963
01:28:38,579 --> 01:28:40,240
Really?

1964
01:28:40,315 --> 01:28:42,749
'Cause I got this outfit
from your mama.

1965
01:28:44,419 --> 01:28:46,353
Yo, Eminem,
cut the wigger shit.

1966
01:28:46,421 --> 01:28:48,685
I don't think you know
how much trouble you in.

1967
01:28:48,756 --> 01:28:51,281
Fine, fine, fine.

1968
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:53,452
I'm here to talk business...

1969
01:28:53,528 --> 01:28:54,859
private business.

1971
01:28:59,067 --> 01:29:00,967
What fresh air is this?

1972
01:29:01,035 --> 01:29:02,593
I don't see him anywhere.

1973
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:05,400
I think he's in that back room
over there.

1974
01:29:05,473 --> 01:29:07,338
What do we do
with Her Majesty?

1975
01:29:07,408 --> 01:29:08,340
Sit down.

1976
01:29:08,409 --> 01:29:09,341
What?

1977
01:29:09,410 --> 01:29:11,776
Sit it on down.

1978
01:29:11,846 --> 01:29:13,746
Now, look, if you move,

1979
01:29:13,815 --> 01:29:15,976
your little Willy
gonna be bridged down.

1980
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:17,984
- You dig?
- Dig.

1981
01:29:18,052 --> 01:29:20,247
All right. Come on.

1982
01:29:21,322 --> 01:29:22,380
Is that real?

1983
01:29:22,457 --> 01:29:23,617
Oh.

1984
01:29:24,625 --> 01:29:26,991
Uh, Seven and Seven, double.

1986
01:29:29,931 --> 01:29:31,421
How you doin'?

1987
01:29:31,499 --> 01:29:32,864
What?!

1988
01:29:32,934 --> 01:29:35,402
I said, "How you doin'?"

1989
01:29:35,470 --> 01:29:36,801
Oh, fantastic.

1991
01:29:41,242 --> 01:29:44,302
You either the dumbest cracker
I ever met or you straight up...

1992
01:29:44,379 --> 01:29:46,313
Hold that thought.
I love this song.

1996
01:29:52,854 --> 01:29:53,650
Turn that off.

1999
01:29:58,025 --> 01:30:00,289
Get everybody up out of here.

2000
01:30:03,531 --> 01:30:06,125
I'm telling you,
he is definitely in there.

2001
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:07,963
Okay, all right,
so he's in there,

2002
01:30:08,035 --> 01:30:10,162
and then <i>you</i> go in,
and then what happens?

2004
01:30:11,305 --> 01:30:12,431
Three seconds.

2005
01:30:12,507 --> 01:30:14,634
Why you here?

2006
01:30:14,709 --> 01:30:17,701
I got a feeling you're sitting
on a hefty sum of stolen cash.

2007
01:30:17,779 --> 01:30:19,804
You want to hide it,
you need a lawyer.

2008
01:30:19,881 --> 01:30:20,939
What's with the phone?

2009
01:30:21,015 --> 01:30:22,448
I'm calling in the cavalry.

2010
01:30:22,517 --> 01:30:23,882
You'll go back to prison.

2011
01:30:23,951 --> 01:30:26,181
So you wanna help me
launder my money?

2012
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:27,983
I can hide it
in an untraceable account

2013
01:30:28,055 --> 01:30:29,386
in the Cayman Islands.

2014
01:30:29,457 --> 01:30:30,856
All I want is $ 100,000.

2015
01:30:30,925 --> 01:30:33,450
We both walk out of here
wealthier men.

2016
01:30:33,528 --> 01:30:36,793
<i>And</i> I tell you where
Charlene is... that simple.

2017
01:30:38,866 --> 01:30:40,697
You wearin' a wire?

2018
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:42,565
Me?

2019
01:30:42,637 --> 01:30:43,968
No. Are you?

2020
01:30:45,206 --> 01:30:47,674
Then...
then they kidnapped me.

2021
01:30:47,742 --> 01:30:50,142
And they took my dog,
William.

2022
01:30:50,211 --> 01:30:51,576
That's a damn shame.

2024
01:30:55,983 --> 01:30:58,451
Oh, you don't care.

2025
01:30:58,519 --> 01:31:00,282
You smokin', Grandma?

2026
01:31:03,224 --> 01:31:04,384
Why not?

2029
01:31:14,769 --> 01:31:16,168
To hell with your proposition.

2030
01:31:16,237 --> 01:31:18,831
Hold it. Charlene is ready
to roll over on you.

2031
01:31:18,906 --> 01:31:20,874
She knows
who your accomplice was.

2032
01:31:20,942 --> 01:31:22,933
- Oh, that's pretty funny.
- I'm not kidding.

2033
01:31:23,010 --> 01:31:25,410
They're out in the parking lot
waiting for my signal and...

2034
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:27,414
and... and...
and the signal is...

2035
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:29,575
if I don't come back,
they call the FBI.

2036
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:31,083
There was no accomplice, fool.

2037
01:31:31,152 --> 01:31:33,211
There was a girl in the photo.

2038
01:31:33,287 --> 01:31:35,278
No, there was somebody
in a wig and a dress.

2040
01:31:36,457 --> 01:31:38,448
You...

2041
01:31:38,526 --> 01:31:41,393
You left her clothes,
the gun, and the money.

2042
01:31:42,897 --> 01:31:44,057
See?

2043
01:31:44,131 --> 01:31:46,361
You just too damn smart
for your own good.

2046
01:31:53,674 --> 01:31:55,369
Look, we can't wait no more.

2047
01:31:55,443 --> 01:31:56,808
Wait, wait. Charlene!

2048
01:31:56,878 --> 01:31:58,470
Open up.
Widow wanna see me.

2049
01:31:58,546 --> 01:31:59,478
Says who?

2050
01:31:59,547 --> 01:32:00,707
Says Lene.

2051
01:32:02,450 --> 01:32:03,144
Pete.

2052
01:32:03,217 --> 01:32:05,583
Well, ain't this
a psychic moment?

2053
01:32:05,653 --> 01:32:07,018
I was just comin' to see you.

2054
01:32:07,088 --> 01:32:09,318
Come on, Widow.
This is between me and you.

2055
01:32:09,390 --> 01:32:10,322
Let him go.

2056
01:32:10,391 --> 01:32:11,722
No problem.

2057
01:32:11,792 --> 01:32:12,986
Ugh!

2058
01:32:13,561 --> 01:32:14,721
Oh, shit.

2059
01:32:14,795 --> 01:32:17,320
What... come on, now.
What are you doin'?

2060
01:32:17,398 --> 01:32:18,456
Ugh!

2061
01:32:18,533 --> 01:32:20,057
I got it.

2062
01:32:20,134 --> 01:32:22,762
- Aim it, aim it, Howie!
- Yeah!

2063
01:32:22,837 --> 01:32:25,806
Uh-huh!
Who got the gun now, huh?

2064
01:32:25,873 --> 01:32:28,603
Who got that gun now?
Homie, that's right.

2065
01:32:28,676 --> 01:32:30,303
Get y'all asses
on the ground!

2066
01:32:30,378 --> 01:32:32,403
Asses on the ground
where I can see 'em, huh?

2067
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:33,504
Take him out!

2071
01:32:42,690 --> 01:32:43,782
Pussies.

2072
01:32:46,093 --> 01:32:47,424
Ooh!

2073
01:32:50,097 --> 01:32:51,462
- Ugh!
- Ooh.

2074
01:32:52,567 --> 01:32:54,091
Ugh!

2075
01:32:58,673 --> 01:33:00,698
Wasn't that fun?

2076
01:33:00,775 --> 01:33:03,243
I'm just gonna roll up
on out of here.

2077
01:33:03,311 --> 01:33:05,506
Thank you.

2080
01:33:16,023 --> 01:33:17,854
- Aah!
- FBI!

2081
01:33:17,925 --> 01:33:19,290
Everybody, freeze!

2082
01:33:20,394 --> 01:33:23,363
Charlene! Charlene!
Oh, baby!

2083
01:33:23,431 --> 01:33:25,194
Oh, oh, baby.

2084
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:27,131
Charlene.

2085
01:33:27,201 --> 01:33:28,566
Son of a...

2086
01:33:29,904 --> 01:33:30,996
Drop it!

2087
01:33:34,742 --> 01:33:36,676
Oh, Charlene.

2089
01:33:39,213 --> 01:33:40,703
What?

2090
01:33:40,781 --> 01:33:42,043
Damn, dog.

2092
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:52,092
Hey, Howie, she's all right.

2093
01:33:54,161 --> 01:33:55,355
Charlene...

2094
01:33:55,429 --> 01:33:56,487
I...

2095
01:33:56,564 --> 01:33:58,896
Do me a favor, precious.

2096
01:33:58,966 --> 01:34:00,797
Don't ever scare me
like that again,

2097
01:34:00,868 --> 01:34:03,200
or I'm gonna have to give you
a nasty spanking,

2098
01:34:03,270 --> 01:34:05,568
if I'm not being too subtle.

2099
01:34:06,974 --> 01:34:09,169
He's such a damn freak.

2100
01:34:10,244 --> 01:34:11,336
Are you Sanderson?

2101
01:34:11,412 --> 01:34:12,208
Yeah.

2102
01:34:13,014 --> 01:34:14,606
Wait, wait.
She's innocent.

2103
01:34:14,682 --> 01:34:16,149
Save it.

2104
01:34:16,217 --> 01:34:18,048
I can prove it.

2107
01:34:27,161 --> 01:34:29,789
Mr. Sanderson...
that was pretty ballsy.

2108
01:34:29,864 --> 01:34:31,456
You'd make a hell of an agent.

2109
01:34:31,532 --> 01:34:34,057
Oh, thank you very much,
but I don't think I did anything

2110
01:34:34,135 --> 01:34:37,298
- an ordinary man wouldn't do...
- Thanks again.

2111
01:34:37,371 --> 01:34:39,737
Mr. Sanderson...

2112
01:34:39,807 --> 01:34:40,967
There you are.

2113
01:34:41,042 --> 01:34:45,069
You have behaved abonidably.

2114
01:34:45,146 --> 01:34:47,444
Aboni...

2115
01:34:47,515 --> 01:34:49,278
Abomidably.

2116
01:34:49,350 --> 01:34:51,409
- Abodi...
- Abominably.

2117
01:34:51,485 --> 01:34:53,612
I know.

2118
01:34:53,688 --> 01:34:54,814
- Shakespeare.
- Shakespeare.

2119
01:34:54,889 --> 01:34:56,117
No, wait.
This is serious.

2120
01:34:56,190 --> 01:34:58,090
And I'll have you dis...

2121
01:34:58,159 --> 01:34:59,387
disboweled.

2123
01:35:00,828 --> 01:35:03,888
Uh, disballed.

2124
01:35:03,964 --> 01:35:06,262
Dis...

2125
01:35:06,333 --> 01:35:07,925
Disbarred?

2126
01:35:08,002 --> 01:35:10,163
Disbarred.

2127
01:35:10,237 --> 01:35:12,068
Oh, to hell with it.

2128
01:35:12,139 --> 01:35:14,733
I do believe I'm stoned.

2129
01:35:14,809 --> 01:35:19,610
Just don't tell anybody
you ever saw me like this.

2130
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:20,738
Mrs. Arness...

2131
01:35:20,815 --> 01:35:22,112
William.

2132
01:35:22,183 --> 01:35:24,117
Oh, God,
you are an ugly dog...

2133
01:35:24,185 --> 01:35:25,277
and heavy.

2134
01:35:25,352 --> 01:35:26,785
Here, I got him.

2135
01:35:26,854 --> 01:35:28,116
Thank you.

2136
01:35:28,189 --> 01:35:31,750
Is there a 24-hour diner
around here?

2137
01:35:31,826 --> 01:35:33,953
I know where one is.
I'll take you there.

2138
01:35:34,028 --> 01:35:35,427
I'm dreadfully hungry.

2139
01:35:35,496 --> 01:35:36,463
You guys okay?

2140
01:35:36,530 --> 01:35:37,497
What do you think?

2141
01:35:37,565 --> 01:35:39,465
Yo, be cool, G-mo.

2142
01:35:39,533 --> 01:35:41,125
Yo, out back, G-mo.

2143
01:35:41,202 --> 01:35:43,568
Full cheesy, homey.

2145
01:35:48,676 --> 01:35:50,007
Well, that's not good enough.

2146
01:35:50,277 --> 01:35:52,438
You'll just have to keep
trying, won't you?

2147
01:35:52,513 --> 01:35:54,640
I called Arness four times.
She'll only talk to Peter.

2148
01:35:54,715 --> 01:35:56,615
Well, we're just gonna
have to keep him around.

2149
01:35:56,684 --> 01:35:57,708
Oh, hey, guys.

2150
01:35:57,785 --> 01:35:59,047
Peter.

2151
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:01,213
Did I mention
I'm going out on my own?

2152
01:36:01,288 --> 01:36:03,950
You don't have the resources.

2153
01:36:04,024 --> 01:36:07,460
Well, I have one
multibillion-dollar client.

2154
01:36:07,528 --> 01:36:09,052
It's a start.

2155
01:36:09,130 --> 01:36:10,256
And a partner.

2156
01:36:10,331 --> 01:36:11,798
I'm all over it, G.

2157
01:36:11,866 --> 01:36:12,890
Let's go.

2158
01:36:12,967 --> 01:36:14,161
Excuse me.

2159
01:36:15,870 --> 01:36:18,532
Peter,
we can talk about this.

2160
01:36:18,606 --> 01:36:23,475
Ed, you can
kiss my natural black ass.

2162
01:36:29,750 --> 01:36:30,739
Peter...

2163
01:36:30,818 --> 01:36:32,445
Ashley,
who are you doing here?

2164
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:35,387
Oh, I was, uh, meeting,
uh, uh...

2165
01:36:35,456 --> 01:36:37,481
- for my aunt's estate.
- About her aunt's estate.

2166
01:36:37,558 --> 01:36:38,991
There was a codicil.

2167
01:36:39,059 --> 01:36:41,527
Well, say goodbye
to half your stuff.

2168
01:36:44,365 --> 01:36:46,094
I'll call you.

2169
01:37:21,168 --> 01:37:23,693
Lookin' good, kids.
Almost there.

2170
01:37:23,771 --> 01:37:27,104
Peter, your 4:00 is waiting
for you in your office.

2171
01:37:27,174 --> 01:37:29,199
I don't have
any meetings today.

2172
01:37:29,276 --> 01:37:32,302
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
I had an appointment.

2173
01:37:33,647 --> 01:37:34,671
Hey.

2174
01:37:34,748 --> 01:37:38,047
So, this is how a big-time
tax attorney lives, huh?

2175
01:37:38,118 --> 01:37:40,814
This place is big pimpin',
P. Diddy.

2176
01:37:40,888 --> 01:37:42,913
- How you doin'?
- I'm a'ight.

2177
01:37:44,458 --> 01:37:46,255
I really wanted
to tell you again

2178
01:37:46,327 --> 01:37:48,318
how much I appreciate
what you did for me.

2179
01:37:49,897 --> 01:37:53,060
If I could only give you back
half of what you've given me.

2180
01:37:53,133 --> 01:37:55,658
Please. We'll call it even.
Now give me a hug.

2181
01:37:55,736 --> 01:37:57,226
Hey, white people don't hug.

2182
01:37:57,304 --> 01:37:58,362
You ain't white.

2183
01:37:58,439 --> 01:37:59,770
Well, I'm off-white.

2184
01:38:01,075 --> 01:38:02,474
Good to see you.

2185
01:38:05,746 --> 01:38:06,770
Kate...

2186
01:38:06,847 --> 01:38:08,178
Hi.

2187
01:38:10,217 --> 01:38:12,879
Um, oh, well, I'm, uh...

2188
01:38:12,953 --> 01:38:15,444
I got to finish up
some things with Howie.

2189
01:38:17,825 --> 01:38:20,794
Oh, Kate, this is Charlene.
Charlene, this is Kate.

2190
01:38:22,696 --> 01:38:25,756
Hi. You've certainly been
shaking things up around here.

2192
01:38:27,334 --> 01:38:29,495
Well, shakin'
is what I do best.

2194
01:38:31,238 --> 01:38:33,263
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Kate.

2195
01:38:33,340 --> 01:38:35,001
Thank you.

2196
01:38:35,075 --> 01:38:38,203
And take care of him for me.

2197
01:38:44,218 --> 01:38:45,207
Hi.

2198
01:38:45,286 --> 01:38:46,878
Hi.

2199
01:38:48,455 --> 01:38:50,514
So...

2200
01:38:50,591 --> 01:38:52,559
what...
what brings you down?

2201
01:38:52,626 --> 01:38:55,151
I mean, you know,
not what brings you down,

2202
01:38:55,229 --> 01:38:57,891
but, I mean,
what brings you down here?

2203
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:03,558
Well, I was
just wondering, um...

2204
01:39:03,637 --> 01:39:06,470
how often do you take
that shortcut past my house?

2205
01:39:08,142 --> 01:39:09,302
Technically?

2206
01:39:09,376 --> 01:39:11,674
Uh, well...

2207
01:39:11,745 --> 01:39:13,576
uh, pretty much every day.

2208
01:39:16,483 --> 01:39:19,008
Well, you know,
technically...

2209
01:39:21,155 --> 01:39:23,123
That's stalking.

2210
01:39:25,459 --> 01:39:27,188
It's kind of cute.

2211
01:39:29,797 --> 01:39:31,355
Kate...

2212
01:39:32,967 --> 01:39:35,094
There's something
I want to say to you.

2213
01:39:41,208 --> 01:39:43,472
The cool points
are out the window,

2214
01:39:43,544 --> 01:39:45,535
and I'm all twisted up
in the game.

2215
01:39:47,915 --> 01:39:50,213
What does that mean?

2216
01:39:50,284 --> 01:39:51,376
It means I love you.

2224
01:40:19,546 --> 01:40:21,571
Rastaman, hold still,
or you're gonna have

2225
01:40:21,648 --> 01:40:23,582
these Jamaican beads
all over the floor.

2226
01:40:23,650 --> 01:40:25,675
Yeah, here we go.

2227
01:40:25,753 --> 01:40:27,277
All right, halfway done.

2229
01:40:28,555 --> 01:40:30,045
What you think?

2231
01:40:31,792 --> 01:40:33,521
Holler at your boy.

2233
01:40:34,928 --> 01:40:36,452
- Hey.
- Nothin' is nothin'.

2234
01:40:36,530 --> 01:40:38,828
Who's your daddy now?

2235
01:40:38,899 --> 01:40:41,800
Boy, you are some kind
of freaky.
