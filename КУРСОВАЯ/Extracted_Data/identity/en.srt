26
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:20,020
As I was going up the stair

27
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:21,980
I met a man who wasn't there

28
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,399
I met a man who wasn't there

29
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:29,071
He wasn't there again today

30
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:35,452
I wish I wish he'd go away

31
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,580
Where did you learn that?

32
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:42,167
Where did you learn that poem?

33
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,711
I made it up.

34
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,298
When I was a kid, I made it up.

35
00:00:51,844 --> 00:00:55,097
What else do you remember from back then?

36
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:02,065
Don't beat around the bush, doc.

37
00:01:02,091 --> 00:01:03,755
Don't beat around the bush.

38
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,094
Don't beat around the bush.

39
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,886
Don't beat around the bush, doc!

40
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,491
Tell me what you remember about your mother.

41
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,411
I remember my mom.

42
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:20,706
I remember my mom.

43
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,960
I remember my mom was a whore.

44
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:37,890
How long would she keep you there?

45
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:43,103
As long as she was busy.

46
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:58,721
Do you understand why you're talking with me now?

47
00:01:58,888 --> 00:02:00,556
You're supposed to be good with...

48
00:02:01,891 --> 00:02:02,892
...headaches.

49
00:02:04,768 --> 00:02:06,633
I need something more than aspirin.

50
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:07,671
Know what I mean?

51
00:02:07,813 --> 00:02:11,817
Do you remember the murders?

52
00:02:13,694 --> 00:02:15,779
I remember...

53
00:02:16,488 --> 00:02:20,117
...that Columbia is the capital of South Carolina.

54
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,246
I remember that--

55
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:37,885
Are you the person who murdered six residents...

56
00:02:38,052 --> 00:02:41,514
...of the Lakeworth Apartments on May 10, 1998?

57
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,562
That's my birthday.

58
00:02:54,026 --> 00:02:56,070
Who am I speaking to right now?

59
00:02:58,572 --> 00:03:01,242
What should I call you?

60
00:03:02,535 --> 00:03:05,788
Call me whatever you want.

61
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,133
Gary?

62
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,010
Gary?

63
00:03:20,594 --> 00:03:22,638
Gary, you awake?

64
00:03:22,805 --> 00:03:26,308
Yes, Greg, as a matter of fact, I am awake.

65
00:03:26,475 --> 00:03:28,269
I'm sorry to bother you at home...

66
00:03:28,435 --> 00:03:31,689
...but there's gonna be a midnight hearing in the Rivers case.

67
00:03:31,897 --> 00:03:35,776
The defense found a notebook misfiled in evidence, a diary.

68
00:03:35,943 --> 00:03:38,863
They argued to the state Supremes that it was suppressed.

69
00:03:39,738 --> 00:03:41,490
What are you talking about?

70
00:03:41,657 --> 00:03:42,714
There's no media.

71
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,977
This all happened under the radar.

72
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:47,580
The prisoner transport left an hour ago from Ely.

73
00:03:47,746 --> 00:03:49,711
Left Ely?
What do you mean?

74
00:03:49,737 --> 00:03:50,900
What transport?

75
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:53,919
The diary gave them an opening to argue insanity again.

76
00:03:54,086 --> 00:03:57,506
They need Rivers present, so they drugged him, put him on a transport.

77
00:03:57,673 --> 00:03:59,842
They're taking this scumbag to a hearing...

78
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:01,844
...the night before his execution.

79
00:04:02,011 --> 00:04:04,221
How the fuck did you let that happen?

80
00:04:08,893 --> 00:04:11,270
Would anyone like to play another round?

81
00:04:12,605 --> 00:04:15,316
Let's get another puzzle, Vanna. What do we have?

82
00:04:15,482 --> 00:04:17,943
-"Around the House" is the category.
-Buy a vowel.

83
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,945
-Buy a vowel.
-Pick up that trip.

84
00:04:20,654 --> 00:04:22,101
Buy a vowel, you idiot.

85
00:04:22,127 --> 00:04:24,266
I'd like to buy a vowel. An E.

86
00:04:24,783 --> 00:04:26,785
One E.

87
00:04:26,994 --> 00:04:30,372
-All right, 350 left.
-N.

88
00:04:31,332 --> 00:04:33,000
-Buy a vowel.
-Buy another vowel.

89
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:35,044
-Yes!
-An I.

90
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,510
-I'd like to solve.
-Sure.

91
00:04:42,718 --> 00:04:44,178
"Kibbles 'n Bits. "

92
00:04:48,516 --> 00:04:49,797
She won't stop bleeding.

93
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:51,210
She won't stop bleeding.

94
00:04:51,352 --> 00:04:52,950
Jesus. What happened?

95
00:04:52,976 --> 00:04:55,714
An accident. We had an accident.

96
00:04:55,898 --> 00:04:58,025
Rain and lightning is moving into Elko.

97
00:04:58,234 --> 00:05:01,654
Doppler Radar has picked up a severe thunderstorm with lightning...

98
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,240
...on its way from Pershing and Lander counties.

99
00:05:04,406 --> 00:05:05,903
We could get damaging winds....

100
00:05:05,929 --> 00:05:07,184
Four times 10 equals--

101
00:05:07,326 --> 00:05:08,577
Four times 10--

102
00:05:08,744 --> 00:05:10,717
Timothy, could you not do that now?

103
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,940
We're trying to hear about the storm.

104
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,752
-Sure you don't want me to drive?
-No.

105
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:21,632
I'll get us to Anderson, then you can take over after we eat.

106
00:05:25,219 --> 00:05:27,471
Turn into spin.

107
00:05:29,515 --> 00:05:31,976
Apply brakes with short, firm pumps.

108
00:05:32,142 --> 00:05:35,729
Check mirror and gauge indicator and roll...

109
00:05:35,938 --> 00:05:39,650
...to a slow, smooth stop.

110
00:05:39,817 --> 00:05:41,902
You okay, honey?
 Timothy?

111
00:05:45,447 --> 00:05:48,659
Seat belts, seat belts, seat belts.

112
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,458
-It's a shoe.
-What?

113
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,919
It's a shoe!

114
00:06:16,395 --> 00:06:19,982
For he's a jolly good fellow

115
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:24,778
For he's a jolly good fellow

116
00:06:24,945 --> 00:06:31,410
For he's a jolly good fellow

117
00:06:33,495 --> 00:06:39,960
Which nobody can deny

118
00:06:51,805 --> 00:06:53,599
Shit!

119
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:00,932
Why didn't we get a better spare?

120
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:03,384
Do you know what radials cost, Alice?

121
00:07:03,526 --> 00:07:05,110
Honey, don't get defensive.

122
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:08,864
Well, if the point is to put him, Timothy, into the right school...

123
00:07:09,031 --> 00:07:11,367
-...it's absurd to focus...
-George? George?

124
00:07:11,534 --> 00:07:12,755
...on replacement tires.

125
00:07:12,781 --> 00:07:14,103
What can I do to help?

126
00:07:14,245 --> 00:07:17,998
Nothing. I'm fine, but...

127
00:07:18,499 --> 00:07:20,543
...thank you.

128
00:07:48,821 --> 00:07:50,049
Oh, my God!

129
00:07:50,075 --> 00:07:52,308
Oh, my God! Alice?

130
00:07:53,367 --> 00:07:55,465
Oh, my God!
Alice?

131
00:07:55,491 --> 00:07:57,938
What have you done?

132
00:07:58,914 --> 00:08:00,677
What have you done?

133
00:08:00,703 --> 00:08:02,651
What have you done?

134
00:08:05,337 --> 00:08:08,591
Hi, Harry.
Where do I begin?

135
00:08:08,757 --> 00:08:11,760
I have walked off the set, okay?

136
00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:14,138
I know they'll say that I am in breach...

137
00:08:14,305 --> 00:08:17,224
...but they clearly did not read my deal.

138
00:08:17,391 --> 00:08:19,685
They had me at a Ramada--

139
00:08:23,522 --> 00:08:25,566
Oh, Jesus.

140
00:08:26,066 --> 00:08:28,652
I think I have a spare battery in my bag.

141
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:30,029
Excuse me?

142
00:08:30,196 --> 00:08:34,283
I have a spare battery in my bag up front, next to you.

143
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,823
Any idea which one, Miss Suzanne?

144
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,939
The Louis Vuitton duffel, right on top.

145
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:46,045
I don't see anything--

146
00:08:46,212 --> 00:08:47,971
Just use your fucking eyes!

147
00:08:47,997 --> 00:08:50,407
It's in the side pocket! Just look!

148
00:08:50,549 --> 00:08:51,842
Jesus!

149
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:02,104
What have you done?

150
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,837
What have you done?

151
00:09:03,979 --> 00:09:07,358
No, fool! If you help him, you assume responsibility.

152
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,139
It is my responsibility.

153
00:09:09,165 --> 00:09:10,094
Let go of me.

154
00:09:10,986 --> 00:09:12,863
Alice? Alice?

155
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,080
What have you done?

156
00:09:14,106 --> 00:09:15,266
What have you done?

157
00:09:15,616 --> 00:09:18,160
Let me take a look.

158
00:09:18,327 --> 00:09:22,623
The driver of every motor vehicle involved in any manner of accident...

159
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:26,627
...originating from the operation of a vehicle shall, within 10 days....

160
00:09:26,794 --> 00:09:29,129
You got a towel or something in the car?

161
00:09:29,296 --> 00:09:31,966
Okay. Come help me look.

162
00:09:33,008 --> 00:09:35,135
--within 10 days of the accident...

163
00:09:35,302 --> 00:09:39,640
...if you are operating a vehicle and it should, at any time, involve--

164
00:09:39,807 --> 00:09:41,630
Stay here. Keep her dry.

165
00:09:41,656 --> 00:09:44,086
It's okay. It's okay, honey.

166
00:09:45,104 --> 00:09:47,481
-Open the door! We need the phone.
-No!

167
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,276
Sweetheart, it's okay.

168
00:09:50,442 --> 00:09:52,194
Honey, it's okay.

169
00:09:54,864 --> 00:09:56,408
Give me the goddamn phone!

170
00:09:56,434 --> 00:09:58,392
The phone is dead, all right?

171
00:09:58,576 --> 00:10:00,686
You're gonna be fine.

172
00:10:00,712 --> 00:10:03,022
You're gonna be okay.

173
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,589
No!

174
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,295
She won't stop bleeding.

175
00:10:34,321 --> 00:10:35,554
Jesus. What happened?

176
00:10:35,696 --> 00:10:36,878
There was an accident.

177
00:10:36,904 --> 00:10:38,515
May I please use your phone?

178
00:10:38,657 --> 00:10:41,744
-Please use your phone?
-Yeah, sure.

179
00:10:44,538 --> 00:10:46,577
Shit. I'm not getting a line.

180
00:10:46,603 --> 00:10:48,359
It happens in the rain.

181
00:10:48,501 --> 00:10:49,668
The phone doesn't work.

182
00:10:49,835 --> 00:10:52,838
St. Jude's has 24-hour emergency,
30 miles east.

183
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,007
Okay.

184
00:10:57,092 --> 00:10:59,220
You sit here, okay?

185
00:11:00,513 --> 00:11:01,883
Keep pressure on the wound.

186
00:11:01,909 --> 00:11:03,582
I'll be back with an ambulance.

187
00:11:13,901 --> 00:11:15,528
What are you doing?

188
00:11:15,694 --> 00:11:18,948
Sorry. It's a step down from the Ramada, but it'll have to do.

189
00:11:19,114 --> 00:11:20,013
I am not staying here.

190
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:21,141
Are you out of your mind?

191
00:11:21,283 --> 00:11:22,251
This is my car.

192
00:11:22,277 --> 00:11:23,476
You work for me.

193
00:11:23,502 --> 00:11:26,105
Get those bags back in this car now!

194
00:11:27,665 --> 00:11:32,711
I understand the bleeding person has a medical condition, but so do I.

195
00:11:32,878 --> 00:11:35,515
My lung walls have depleted cilia.

196
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,409
If I stay here, I could asphyxiate!

197
00:11:42,638 --> 00:11:46,308
No, please, please, please, please, please, please.

198
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:48,894
Please!

199
00:11:56,277 --> 00:11:57,611
Hey!

200
00:12:03,158 --> 00:12:04,869
Stop. Please, please.

201
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,580
Hi. I'm sorry, my car is stuck.

202
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:11,984
Can I get a ride?

203
00:12:12,126 --> 00:12:13,919
Okay.

204
00:12:31,979 --> 00:12:34,023
You know you're going east.

205
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:37,193
Hospital's this way.

206
00:12:38,402 --> 00:12:39,806
It's flooded.

207
00:12:39,832 --> 00:12:42,640
I mean, it's a dead end.

208
00:12:42,948 --> 00:12:46,410
Yeah, well, if you don't mind, I gotta try.

209
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:55,503
Okay, that will be $30 cash, please.

210
00:13:01,383 --> 00:13:03,552
Didn't you use to be that actress?

211
00:13:06,347 --> 00:13:08,224
Yes.

212
00:13:09,725 --> 00:13:13,187
-Wow.
-Now, is that a nice room?

213
00:13:14,855 --> 00:13:19,693
Because though I am leaving soon, I still would prefer a nice room.

214
00:13:21,904 --> 00:13:23,906
Your nicest...

215
00:13:25,157 --> 00:13:27,034
...if that is possible.

216
00:13:32,873 --> 00:13:35,000
Eight's very cozy.

217
00:13:44,051 --> 00:13:46,554
I tried to tell you.

218
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:50,281
Hey! Hey, stop!

219
00:13:50,307 --> 00:13:52,626
There's no way through.

220
00:13:52,768 --> 00:13:54,327
There's no way through!

221
00:13:54,353 --> 00:13:55,504
No way through!

222
00:13:55,646 --> 00:13:57,106
-Lou, wake up.
-What?

223
00:13:57,773 --> 00:13:59,275
Cell phone.

224
00:13:59,441 --> 00:14:01,485
-What?
-Do you have a cell phone?

225
00:14:01,652 --> 00:14:03,070
Who wants to know?

226
00:14:03,737 --> 00:14:05,651
There's been an accident, a bad one.

227
00:14:05,677 --> 00:14:06,473
A lady's hurt.

228
00:14:06,615 --> 00:14:08,364
We need a cell phone right now.

229
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,518
Dude, slow down.

230
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,316
First, we don't know who you are.

231
00:14:11,342 --> 00:14:13,147
Second, we don't see an accident--

232
00:14:13,289 --> 00:14:17,001
Listen to me, dude, I'm having a really fucked-up, wet, bad fucking day.

233
00:14:17,168 --> 00:14:19,628
So if you have a cell phone, give it to me now!

234
00:14:19,837 --> 00:14:25,259
Dude, we don't have a cell phone, so could you just let go of me now?!

235
00:14:26,844 --> 00:14:29,597
I need you to give me a lift in the other direction.

236
00:14:29,763 --> 00:14:31,666
It's flooded that way too.

237
00:14:31,692 --> 00:14:33,375
It's worse than this.

238
00:14:35,311 --> 00:14:37,188
Ginny, pop the trunk.
Let them in.

239
00:14:38,856 --> 00:14:40,441
Let them in.

240
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,585
Hey. How you doing?

241
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,275
Phone still dead?

242
00:15:07,301 --> 00:15:09,078
Yeah. Where's your Lincoln?

243
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,362
Stuck in a run-off two miles down the road.

244
00:15:11,388 --> 00:15:12,831
The other way's fucked too.

245
00:15:12,973 --> 00:15:13,974
The kids gave us a lift.

246
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
The girl was stranded.

247
00:15:15,476 --> 00:15:16,866
Is there another way out?

248
00:15:16,892 --> 00:15:18,003
Is she a hooker?

249
00:15:18,103 --> 00:15:19,730
Hey! Is there a back road?

250
00:15:19,939 --> 00:15:21,363
Where do you think the water's going?

251
00:15:21,389 --> 00:15:22,466
You wouldn't get 500 feet.

252
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:23,725
How's the woman?

253
00:15:23,751 --> 00:15:24,727
I don't know.

254
00:15:24,753 --> 00:15:26,328
They're in number 4.

255
00:15:41,627 --> 00:15:42,296
I'm sorry.

256
00:15:42,322 --> 00:15:44,530
We don't rent rooms by the hour.

257
00:15:46,423 --> 00:15:49,677
Funny. You still serving food?

258
00:15:49,844 --> 00:15:53,931
Vending machines are around the corner. Go ahead.

259
00:15:54,098 --> 00:15:56,984
Rooms are 30 bucks in advance with picture ID.

260
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,544
You need one room or two?

261
00:15:58,727 --> 00:16:00,321
Excuse me. I was talking to you.

262
00:16:00,347 --> 00:16:02,339
I'd appreciate it if you looked at me.

263
00:16:03,065 --> 00:16:05,568
Well, I don't like looking at trash.

264
00:16:12,908 --> 00:16:15,025
We're a little stuck here, George.

265
00:16:15,051 --> 00:16:17,479
I don't think we can get out tonight.

266
00:16:17,621 --> 00:16:20,225
She just keeps shaking.

267
00:16:20,251 --> 00:16:22,401
She's in shock.

268
00:16:22,543 --> 00:16:24,920
-Let me take a look.
-What?

269
00:16:25,129 --> 00:16:27,673
Let me take a look.

270
00:16:44,648 --> 00:16:46,609
Did your wife pack a sewing kit?

271
00:16:47,318 --> 00:16:48,569
No.

272
00:16:53,741 --> 00:16:55,201
Ginny, wait up.

273
00:16:58,662 --> 00:17:00,831
Six.

274
00:17:01,373 --> 00:17:04,126
At least we got a good number.

275
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:55,408
-Did you feel that?
-Feel what?

276
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,243
Cold.

277
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:12,717
Are you the manager?

278
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:14,886
Yeah.

279
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,677
I'm Officer Rhodes, Corrections.

280
00:18:17,703 --> 00:18:20,208
I'm transporting a prisoner here.

281
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:23,228
The law gives you the right to refuse us service...

282
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:24,821
...but the roads are flooded.

283
00:18:24,847 --> 00:18:25,880
I could use a room.

284
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:27,253
It's an emergency.

285
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:29,467
You got a radio in that car?

286
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,736
-Who's this?
-Limo driver, had an accident.

287
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:33,571
I got a lady pretty banged up.

288
00:18:33,597 --> 00:18:35,098
I could use an ambulance.

289
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,117
Four-four-two requesting medical.

290
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,995
Four-four-two requesting medical.

291
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,873
Nothing. It's been like this for the past hour.

292
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,418
She's losing a lot of blood.

293
00:18:45,444 --> 00:18:46,526
Got a first aid kit?

294
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:48,044
Band-Aids, that's it.

295
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:49,675
How about a needle and thread?

296
00:18:49,701 --> 00:18:50,822
Maybe in the diner.

297
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:54,039
I'll get it.
 Locked up.

298
00:18:54,065 --> 00:18:55,535
Stay dry.

299
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,173
I'll be back with your key.

300
00:18:57,199 --> 00:18:58,329
I'll put you in 10.

301
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,432
Okay, thanks.

302
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,749
What do you got back there?

303
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:04,018
Prison transfer.

304
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:07,564
Maybe when you get him situated, come to 4 and look at the lady.

305
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,942
-I could use a second opinion.
-Yeah, sure.

306
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:21,661
Looks like you're fucked.

307
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:23,788
Shut up!

308
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,169
I wish I had beige.

309
00:19:39,195 --> 00:19:40,455
This is fine.

310
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:42,974
Would have been better.

311
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:44,477
I gotta get the officer situated.

312
00:19:44,503 --> 00:19:45,960
Let me know if you need something.

313
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:48,104
I'll be right back.

314
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,113
Where did you learn to do that?

315
00:19:57,572 --> 00:20:00,325
Pretty much where you're standing.

316
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:16,049
Hey, is the...?

317
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,719
The little boy, is he all right?

318
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:22,305
He hasn't said a word since the accident.

319
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:27,060
No, no, no.
 He doesn't talk much ever since the....

320
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:31,940
I'm his stepfather.

321
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:34,234
His father....

322
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:38,029
Two years ago, he left.

323
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:42,033
Little temper problem.

324
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:00,051
Watch your step.

325
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:08,560
The furniture's for shit.

326
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:13,064
If you're fixing to cuff him to something, the toilet's bolted down.

327
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:15,149
Thank you so much for your assistance.

328
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:16,981
It's a good idea. Come on.

329
00:21:17,007 --> 00:21:18,094
I got stripes

330
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:22,657
Stripes around my shoulders And these chains

331
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:25,118
These chains They're about to--

332
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:30,999
Let's go look at that lady.

333
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:37,714
-You get anyone?
-What?

334
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:41,426
-Did you get through?
-No, not yet.

335
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:49,350
Good stitch job.

336
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:53,930
Pulse is shallow, but steady.

337
00:21:53,956 --> 00:21:55,173
Keep her comfortable.

338
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:57,817
We should take turns on the radio, if that's all right.

339
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:01,154
No, it's not. I can manage.

340
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:20,340
You gonna arrest me, officer?

341
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:25,845
What?

342
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,172
How'd you do that?

343
00:22:28,198 --> 00:22:30,333
How'd you know I was a cop?

344
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,147
No shit.

345
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:41,402
Cheetos for dinner, huh?

346
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:43,194
That don't seem right.

347
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,139
You got a better idea?

348
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:47,209
I worked mess in the service.

349
00:22:47,235 --> 00:22:49,561
Maybe the diner's open. I could--

350
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:52,705
You got change for a dollar?

351
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:56,251
I don't know. Let me see.

352
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,971
Here you go.

353
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:11,349
You got a name?

354
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:15,478
-Paris.
-Paris, huh?

355
00:23:15,687 --> 00:23:16,980
I'll get it.

356
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:19,315
Never been.

357
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:22,652
Well, you ain't going tonight.

358
00:23:33,163 --> 00:23:35,039
Please.

359
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:37,959
Please be strong.

360
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:42,380
You see, Timothy and I...

361
00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:44,924
...we need you.

362
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:48,178
We need you so much.

363
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,863
Lou?

364
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:53,409
Lou?

365
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:27,569
You need to tell them, Harry, that I can't work, I can't perform...

366
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:30,613
...I can't shine living in an environment like that.

367
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,790
No, it is not about the money.

368
00:25:32,816 --> 00:25:35,226
It's about the working conditions.

369
00:26:06,858 --> 00:26:08,776
One bar.

370
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,321
One bar.

371
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:12,655
No bar.

372
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:15,200
One bar.

373
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:16,534
Two bars.

374
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:20,830
Come on. Come on.

375
00:26:21,456 --> 00:26:23,208
Here we go.

376
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:28,421
There you go. Come on.

377
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,844
Goddamn desert wasteland!

378
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:44,271
Oh, shit!

379
00:26:44,297 --> 00:26:46,798
I just had it.

00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:31,289
Holy fuck.

401
00:31:00,985 --> 00:31:03,092
Jesus, Mother of God.

402
00:31:03,118 --> 00:31:04,722
Who is this?

403
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:08,117
The woman I was driving.

404
00:31:11,037 --> 00:31:12,561
What the hell are you doing?

405
00:31:12,587 --> 00:31:14,274
There's something in there.

406
00:31:14,415 --> 00:31:16,501
-Use this, man.
-Thanks.

407
00:31:16,668 --> 00:31:19,879
-Are you a cop?
-I was.

408
00:31:27,637 --> 00:31:30,932
-She was in Room 10?
-I am.

409
00:31:32,642 --> 00:31:34,344
Where's your guy?

410
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:36,671
Cuffed to a toilet.

411
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:48,867
Son of a bitch.

412
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,579
That was a fucking drive.

413
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:59,752
-Gentlemen.
-Your Honor.

414
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:09,846
Ready, Sharon? Alrighty.

415
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:13,433
In the matter of Rivers v. Nevada, for the purposes of--

416
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:19,189
Judge Taylor, sir, with due respect, we should wait till my client arrives.

417
00:32:19,689 --> 00:32:21,604
He has a right to be present.

418
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:23,676
He has precious few rights.

419
00:32:23,818 --> 00:32:25,737
He's 24 hours from execution.

420
00:32:26,821 --> 00:32:29,824
But to demonstrate his mental state, which is the purpose--

421
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,035
His mental state?

422
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:34,370
His mental state?

423
00:32:34,913 --> 00:32:36,665
Do you know what time it is?

424
00:32:36,691 --> 00:32:38,942
You think I got time for bullshit?

425
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:42,670
That the justices called me in the middle of the night to review a case...

426
00:32:42,879 --> 00:32:47,300
...I already sat on, that I already decided, may make you happy.

427
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:49,511
But it pisses me off.

428
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:53,681
When your boy gets here, do what you want, but in the name of decency...

429
00:32:53,848 --> 00:32:56,392
...state your goddamn case!

430
00:32:58,269 --> 00:33:00,396
Yes, sir.

431
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:02,565
Somebody get me
a cup of coffee, black.

432
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:12,408
All right, everybody! Listen up!

433
00:33:13,368 --> 00:33:14,994
There was an incident tonight.

434
00:33:15,161 --> 00:33:17,247
That's police talk for, "Someone's head got lopped off."

435
00:33:17,455 --> 00:33:18,832
Larry!

436
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:23,211
-Caroline Suzanne was murdered.
-What?

437
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:25,030
Who's Caroline Suzanne?

438
00:33:25,056 --> 00:33:27,156
The actress I was driving.

439
00:33:27,298 --> 00:33:30,552
And where exactly did that happen?

440
00:33:30,718 --> 00:33:33,930
We don't know, because we can't find the body.

441
00:33:34,138 --> 00:33:35,598
Not all of it anyway.

442
00:33:35,765 --> 00:33:38,036
What do you mean, you can't find it?

443
00:33:38,062 --> 00:33:40,837
Stay calm. Everything will be all right.

444
00:33:40,979 --> 00:33:42,755
Officer Rhodes is outside.

445
00:33:42,781 --> 00:33:44,966
He was transporting a convict.

446
00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:47,652
-Who escaped.
-What are you--?

447
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,655
-Hold on.
-Running free!

448
00:33:50,822 --> 00:33:53,283
Will you shut the fuck up so he can talk?

449
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:54,801
This is my place, ho!

450
00:33:54,827 --> 00:33:56,436
I'll say what I please!

451
00:33:56,578 --> 00:33:57,203
It's safe here.

452
00:33:57,229 --> 00:33:58,229
It is not safe here!

453
00:33:58,371 --> 00:33:59,331
There's a cop here.

454
00:33:59,357 --> 00:34:00,315
Yeah, two cops.

455
00:34:00,456 --> 00:34:02,125
Wait. You're a cop?

456
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:04,256
I was. Shut up, Larry!

457
00:34:04,282 --> 00:34:06,121
It's not safe here!

458
00:34:06,147 --> 00:34:07,889
I'm not staying--

459
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:10,967
It's all right. It's okay.

460
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,637
Nothing.

461
00:34:14,846 --> 00:34:18,057
-Is she okay?
-Ginny.

462
00:34:18,349 --> 00:34:19,802
Ginny, will you...?

463
00:34:19,828 --> 00:34:22,503
Stop it. 
Don't do this right now.

464
00:34:23,396 --> 00:34:24,309
What are you doing?

465
00:34:24,335 --> 00:34:26,257
Put your arm around your girlfriend.

466
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,250
Actually, she's my wife.

467
00:34:28,276 --> 00:34:30,512
Everybody just stay here.

468
00:34:30,653 --> 00:34:31,598
Stay in this room.

469
00:34:31,624 --> 00:34:33,723
Wait! I'm not staying here if he is.

470
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:35,492
-Yes, you are.
-No, I'm not.

471
00:34:35,658 --> 00:34:39,204
-I'm not.
-All right. Larry?

472
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:40,830
-Come with us.
-Why?

473
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,053
You know the place.

474
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,166
Here's what I know.

475
00:34:43,192 --> 00:34:44,050
I'm not a cop.

476
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:46,753
I don't take orders from a professional slut!

477
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:50,089
-Fuck you!
-Listen. Just stay here, please.

478
00:34:50,256 --> 00:34:51,925
Keep everybody calm.

479
00:35:00,475 --> 00:35:02,535
He's not gonna get too far.

480
00:35:02,561 --> 00:35:03,628
Not in this!

481
00:35:05,396 --> 00:35:07,357
Rhodes!

482
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,234
What are we chasing here?

483
00:35:12,111 --> 00:35:14,906
Multiple homicide.

484
00:35:15,323 --> 00:35:17,232
I'll go around this way.

485
00:35:17,258 --> 00:35:18,768
Meet you in back.

486
00:35:32,006 --> 00:35:35,009
Is that where you live full-time?
Las Vegas?

487
00:35:36,135 --> 00:35:39,430
-Used to.
-What's that supposed to mean?

488
00:35:41,266 --> 00:35:44,394
It means I don't live there anymore.

489
00:36:21,097 --> 00:36:22,348
Maine!

490
00:36:23,892 --> 00:36:26,322
We'll go see if we can use this one.

491
00:36:26,348 --> 00:36:27,629
We'll go in here.

492
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:31,274
Since that wasn't a successful attempt, we'll go in here.

493
00:36:31,566 --> 00:36:34,231
I'll be right out here. 
It's okay.

494
00:36:34,257 --> 00:36:36,137
I'm gonna stand guard.

495
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:37,381
Not a worry.

496
00:36:37,407 --> 00:36:39,079
I'll be right here.

497
00:36:39,105 --> 00:36:41,226
I'm not going anywhere.

498
00:36:48,082 --> 00:36:52,295
See, his mother usually does this.

499
00:37:13,274 --> 00:37:14,467
Hey, Ginny.

500
00:37:14,493 --> 00:37:18,179
So how long you two been married?

501
00:37:18,321 --> 00:37:19,420
About nine hours.

502
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:22,225
It was a spur-of-the-moment kind of thing.

503
00:37:22,867 --> 00:37:24,536
Viva Las Vegas, huh, Gin?

504
00:37:25,537 --> 00:37:26,487
We need to leave!

505
00:37:26,513 --> 00:37:28,189
I was just talking to her.

506
00:37:28,373 --> 00:37:29,511
Something's happening!

507
00:37:29,537 --> 00:37:30,984
I need to get out of here!

508
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:32,905
Ginny! Ginny!

509
00:37:32,931 --> 00:37:36,406
You don't own me, Lou!

510
00:37:36,548 --> 00:37:37,891
I own what's inside you!

511
00:37:37,917 --> 00:37:38,867
Half, at least.

512
00:37:39,008 --> 00:37:41,970
You don't own any part of me or my baby!

513
00:37:42,136 --> 00:37:43,930
Then why did I marry you?

514
00:37:44,556 --> 00:37:49,102
-Don't slam the goddamn door on me!
-Hey! Hey!

515
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:51,771
You guys, just calm down!

516
00:37:58,069 --> 00:37:59,717
We are not leaving.

517
00:37:59,743 --> 00:38:02,432
There is no place else to go.

518
00:38:02,574 --> 00:38:05,082
There's a flood outside, Ginny.

519
00:38:05,108 --> 00:38:06,644
Stop it! Stop it!

520
00:38:06,786 --> 00:38:09,664
I'm not pregnant!

521
00:38:13,793 --> 00:38:16,171
What did you just say?

522
00:38:18,965 --> 00:38:21,301
I lied.

523
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:24,679
I'm not pregnant.

524
00:38:27,849 --> 00:38:29,794
What are you talking about?

525
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,044
I saw the test.

526
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:37,692
Why would you do that to me?

527
00:38:38,568 --> 00:38:42,947
Because Alison saw you at The Hawk with that fucking girl!

528
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:51,247
-Ginny, what are we, like 15?
-Go away!

529
00:38:52,665 --> 00:38:55,001
Goddamn!

530
00:39:14,103 --> 00:39:17,357
-Open this goddamn door, Ginny!
-No!

531
00:39:17,524 --> 00:39:20,360
I haven't been to The Hawk in over a fucking year.

532
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:26,282
Alison is a stupid bitch-whore, who likes fucking with your head.

533
00:39:26,449 --> 00:39:28,785
Open the damn door, Ginny.

534
00:39:28,993 --> 00:39:30,663
Open the fucking door!

535
00:39:30,689 --> 00:39:32,814
Not until you calm down!

536
00:39:33,164 --> 00:39:37,043
I'm calm! I am very fucking calm!

537
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:49,180
What are you doing?

538
00:39:52,267 --> 00:39:55,019
Lou?

539
00:40:09,325 --> 00:40:11,970
Ginny, open this damn door!

540
00:40:11,996 --> 00:40:13,563
Open the door!

541
00:40:14,038 --> 00:40:16,833
-Open the door!
-Stop it, stop it!

542
00:40:18,001 --> 00:40:20,599
Ginny, damn it, open the door!

543
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:22,530
Ginny, Ginny, Ginny!

544
00:40:22,672 --> 00:40:25,091
Lou, please stop!

545
00:41:03,004 --> 00:41:05,381
Lou?

546
00:41:46,589 --> 00:41:48,484
Oh, my God!

547
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:50,994
Oh, my God!

548
00:41:51,135 --> 00:41:51,995
Help me!

549
00:41:52,021 --> 00:41:53,955
Somebody help me!

550
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,357
Help me!

551
00:42:04,732 --> 00:42:05,797
Help me!

552
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:08,219
Somebody help me!

553
00:42:08,611 --> 00:42:10,132
Is he in there?

554
00:42:10,558 --> 00:42:12,307
Is he in there?

555
00:42:13,867 --> 00:42:15,273
Ginny, are you okay?

556
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:17,478
What happened? 
What happened?

557
00:42:24,169 --> 00:42:27,172
-Oh, shit.
-Jesus Christ.

558
00:42:35,555 --> 00:42:38,600
Lou? Lou?

559
00:42:39,767 --> 00:42:41,853
What's going on?

560
00:44:04,602 --> 00:44:05,937
What the hell?

561
00:44:09,107 --> 00:44:10,984
Oh, shit!

562
00:44:13,236 --> 00:44:15,405
Come here!

563
00:44:30,044 --> 00:44:31,925
They caught him.

564
00:44:31,951 --> 00:44:33,948
They caught him.

565
00:44:42,056 --> 00:44:44,475
Why are we keeping him in here?

566
00:44:45,268 --> 00:44:47,291
Where would you prefer, Larry?

567
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:48,463
I don't know.

568
00:44:48,688 --> 00:44:50,284
I told you to stay in 3, didn't I?

569
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:51,341
Did I tell you that?

570
00:44:51,483 --> 00:44:53,109
They got in a fight!

571
00:44:53,135 --> 00:44:56,304
I tried to get them to go back inside!

572
00:44:56,446 --> 00:44:59,199
Should we try the radio again?

573
00:44:59,491 --> 00:45:03,328
Larry, just stay here and watch him.

574
00:45:03,495 --> 00:45:05,412
Go back and look after Ginny.

575
00:45:05,438 --> 00:45:07,023
Where are you going?

576
00:45:07,332 --> 00:45:10,001
Just do it, please.

577
00:45:10,919 --> 00:45:12,170
Ed?

578
00:45:15,924 --> 00:45:18,551
I don't know if I'm comfortable with guard duty, per se.

579
00:45:19,219 --> 00:45:20,872
He's unconscious, Larry.

580
00:45:20,898 --> 00:45:22,413
He's tied to a post.

581
00:45:45,411 --> 00:45:47,831
Timothy.

582
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:52,836
Timothy.

583
00:45:59,259 --> 00:46:04,556
Alice? Oh, my God. Alice?

584
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:08,268
I don't remember anything.

585
00:46:09,018 --> 00:46:11,563
We had an accident.

586
00:46:12,522 --> 00:46:15,024
George?
Can you keep an eye on Ginny for a minute?

587
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:17,122
She's awake now.

588
00:46:17,148 --> 00:46:21,556
I have to get some aspirin to help her.

589
00:46:22,907 --> 00:46:26,035
Darling, I gotta go get something out of my room.

590
00:46:42,802 --> 00:46:45,597
-Shit!
-What's wrong, buddy?

591
00:46:46,264 --> 00:46:48,099
What do you got in the fridge?

592
00:46:48,975 --> 00:46:49,992
You shut up.

593
00:46:50,018 --> 00:46:51,711
What's in there?

594
00:46:54,105 --> 00:46:56,733
What's in there?

595
00:46:56,941 --> 00:46:58,902
-What do you got in there?
-Shut up.

596
00:46:59,277 --> 00:47:01,112
What is it, huh?

597
00:47:01,279 --> 00:47:03,072
-Shut up.
-You can tell me.

598
00:47:03,364 --> 00:47:05,524
I'm good at keeping secrets.

599
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:07,477
I got a whopper myself.

600
00:47:26,846 --> 00:47:28,431
What are you doing?

601
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:30,099
Motherfucker!

602
00:47:30,266 --> 00:47:32,151
What are you doing out here?

603
00:47:32,177 --> 00:47:34,128
Getting shit that's mine.

604
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:35,480
What are you doing?

605
00:47:35,506 --> 00:47:37,924
What, I don't get to ask a question?

606
00:47:38,066 --> 00:47:38,933
I'm taking photos.

607
00:47:38,959 --> 00:47:40,185
There's been two murders.

608
00:47:40,211 --> 00:47:41,511
Before all the evidence--

609
00:47:41,653 --> 00:47:43,008
That's not an answer.

610
00:47:43,034 --> 00:47:44,427
You're a limo driver.

611
00:47:44,453 --> 00:47:45,807
What are you doing?

612
00:47:45,949 --> 00:47:49,869
Looking to win some "beyond the call of duty," limo-driver merit badge?

613
00:47:50,036 --> 00:47:51,684
You're not on the job anymore.

614
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:53,356
You don't need to be a hero.

615
00:47:53,498 --> 00:47:55,875
There's a real, live, active-duty cop outside--

616
00:47:56,042 --> 00:47:58,837
The one who's managed to lose a convicted killer?

617
00:48:01,422 --> 00:48:03,174
You're a complicated cat, Edward.

618
00:48:04,342 --> 00:48:06,719
No. Not really.

619
00:48:07,136 --> 00:48:09,389
I think so.

620
00:48:11,641 --> 00:48:14,060
What month were you born?

621
00:48:14,602 --> 00:48:17,480
-May.
-Taurus.

622
00:48:18,565 --> 00:48:20,358
Same as me.

623
00:48:23,695 --> 00:48:25,754
Where were you a cop?

624
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:27,348
Los Angeles.

625
00:48:27,866 --> 00:48:31,035
Were you fired or did you quit?

626
00:48:31,452 --> 00:48:33,705
I took medical leave.

627
00:48:34,247 --> 00:48:37,000
It was making me sick.

628
00:48:38,209 --> 00:48:39,955
I burned out, I guess.

629
00:48:39,981 --> 00:48:41,487
Wasn't up for it.

630
00:48:45,592 --> 00:48:47,802
One day I got a call...

631
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:52,515
...for a jumper.

632
00:48:52,682 --> 00:48:54,642
A young Mexican girl.

633
00:48:57,187 --> 00:49:00,648
Pregnant, infected with AIDS, totally strung-out.

634
00:49:01,232 --> 00:49:04,819
She was truly one of the doomed.

635
00:49:07,864 --> 00:49:11,743
I asked her to come in off the ledge and into my arms.

636
00:49:12,327 --> 00:49:15,330
She asked me why she should bother living.

637
00:49:21,753 --> 00:49:24,088
What did you say?

638
00:49:26,174 --> 00:49:28,927
I was trained to tell her lots of things.

639
00:49:28,968 --> 00:49:32,263
Her dreams, all the people who'd miss her.

640
00:49:33,139 --> 00:49:36,059
But for a second, I hesitated.

641
00:49:37,185 --> 00:49:39,229
And she saw it.

642
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:47,946
Within that second, I couldn't think of one optimistic thing to say to her.

643
00:49:51,741 --> 00:49:54,953
So she spread her arms and jumped.

644
00:50:00,166 --> 00:50:02,460
I started getting headaches...

645
00:50:04,754 --> 00:50:07,924
...and eventually started blacking out.

646
00:50:09,175 --> 00:50:13,513
So I filed for medical.

647
00:50:29,404 --> 00:50:31,531
What?

648
00:50:33,825 --> 00:50:35,577
What is it?

649
00:50:39,914 --> 00:50:41,749
Rhodes!

650
00:50:41,916 --> 00:50:44,202
It's worse. 
Nothing but static!

651
00:50:44,228 --> 00:50:47,030
Where's that key from the actress?

652
00:50:48,464 --> 00:50:50,758
This was on the kid.

653
00:50:52,468 --> 00:50:55,221
-What is it, some kind of countdown?
-Larry!

654
00:50:57,765 --> 00:50:59,630
What the fuck is he doing?

655
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:01,377
Larry, come over here!

656
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:03,352
Come over here, man.

657
00:51:03,378 --> 00:51:04,715
What are you doing?

658
00:51:04,741 --> 00:51:05,865
Come over here.

659
00:51:07,192 --> 00:51:08,335
What are you doing?

660
00:51:08,361 --> 00:51:10,345
I just went to get something.

661
00:51:11,237 --> 00:51:12,893
We told you to watch the guy.

662
00:51:12,919 --> 00:51:14,974
What are you doing in your office?

663
00:51:15,742 --> 00:51:17,202
I just went to get something.

664
00:51:17,368 --> 00:51:19,925
How many sets of keys are there to this place?

665
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:21,147
Look at me. 
How many?

666
00:51:21,289 --> 00:51:22,444
Two and a master set.

667
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:23,733
Oh, my fucking God!

668
00:51:24,542 --> 00:51:27,754
Larry, you mother--!
You son of a--!

669
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:30,990
Get the fuck in here!
Get in here!

670
00:51:33,009 --> 00:51:34,164
Why did you kill him?

671
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:35,620
Why did you kill my con?

672
00:51:35,762 --> 00:51:37,834
Holy shit! Who did that?

673
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:40,708
Jesus Christ, I didn't do that!

674
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:42,435
Bullshit! You're lying!

675
00:51:42,602 --> 00:51:44,835
It's your bat sticking out of his throat!

676
00:51:44,861 --> 00:51:46,548
I know, but I didn't do it!

677
00:51:46,689 --> 00:51:48,399
Check the doors!

678
00:51:48,608 --> 00:51:50,235
-I didn't do it!
-Look at him!

679
00:51:50,401 --> 00:51:51,788
Why'd you kill him?

680
00:51:51,814 --> 00:51:53,638
Why were you outside?

681
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:54,885
Why'd you leave him?

682
00:51:54,911 --> 00:51:55,849
I was scared.

683
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:57,030
What were you scared of?

684
00:51:57,056 --> 00:51:58,268
You wouldn't understand.

685
00:51:58,409 --> 00:51:59,869
Try me.

686
00:52:00,036 --> 00:52:01,788
-Why'd you kill my con?
-I didn't!

687
00:52:01,955 --> 00:52:03,840
I don't know how-- I went

688
00:52:03,866 --> 00:52:05,900
to my office, that's all!

689
00:52:06,042 --> 00:52:07,154
Why'd you leave him?

690
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:08,736
This your key? Number 8?

691
00:52:08,878 --> 00:52:10,288
Ten, nine, eight, huh?

692
00:52:10,314 --> 00:52:11,531
This is your key!

693
00:52:11,673 --> 00:52:12,560
You can't say that!

694
00:52:12,586 --> 00:52:13,658
Those aren't my keys!

695
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,803
That's like leading the witness or something. Look.

696
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:18,632
These are my keys, okay?

697
00:52:18,658 --> 00:52:20,665
These are my keys. 
You see?

698
00:52:22,183 --> 00:52:23,426
You got a Gucci wallet?

699
00:52:23,452 --> 00:52:24,586
It's the actress's.

700
00:52:24,727 --> 00:52:26,683
Yes, I took her wallet.

701
00:52:26,709 --> 00:52:29,174
Afterwards. After she died!

702
00:52:29,315 --> 00:52:31,136
Afterwards, all right?

703
00:52:31,162 --> 00:52:32,709
I didn't kill her.

704
00:52:32,735 --> 00:52:34,721
And I didn't kill him.

705
00:52:34,863 --> 00:52:36,378
Let her go, Larry.

706
00:52:36,404 --> 00:52:39,684
Get back!
You won't pin this on me.

707
00:52:39,826 --> 00:52:41,870
-Timothy?
-Get him out of here!

708
00:52:42,036 --> 00:52:42,907
Put it down.

709
00:52:42,933 --> 00:52:45,398
I didn't hurt anybody. No one!

710
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:47,456
But I don't like cheap fucking whores!

711
00:52:47,482 --> 00:52:48,943
If you take one more step--

712
00:52:49,085 --> 00:52:51,421
Fuck!

713
00:52:59,596 --> 00:53:01,598
Get it off!

714
00:53:05,435 --> 00:53:06,561
Shit!

715
00:53:14,527 --> 00:53:15,988
Come on, you little bitch.

716
00:53:16,014 --> 00:53:17,305
Please fucking start.

717
00:53:17,864 --> 00:53:20,617
-Goddamn it!
-Hey!

718
00:53:21,534 --> 00:53:23,828
Larry, stop!

719
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,416
What is going on?

720
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,294
-Larry!
-Get out of my way, I didn't do shit!

721
00:53:34,672 --> 00:53:37,300
Timothy! Timothy!

722
00:53:59,823 --> 00:54:02,200
An insanity plea was refused by the court...

723
00:54:02,367 --> 00:54:06,871
...despite the fact that my client is a certifiable Axis IV dissociative.

724
00:54:07,038 --> 00:54:11,709
To this day, he remains unaware of the crimes for which he was convicted.

725
00:54:11,876 --> 00:54:17,674
In 1986, the Supreme Court ruled decisively that states cannot execute...

726
00:54:17,799 --> 00:54:21,094
...a person who does not understand why he's being put to death.

727
00:54:21,261 --> 00:54:22,554
He signed a confession.

728
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:26,266
-He didn't just sign it, he dictated it.
-Thirdly...

729
00:54:26,432 --> 00:54:31,938
...Malcolm's diaries found misfiled in state evidence.

730
00:54:32,105 --> 00:54:37,068
Your Honor, this notebook contains entries made just before the murders.

731
00:54:37,235 --> 00:54:41,573
Important to note are the spectacular changes in handwriting style...

732
00:54:41,739 --> 00:54:43,491
...tone, point of view.

733
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:48,538
What you are looking at are the private thoughts of several different people.

734
00:54:48,705 --> 00:54:52,458
With permission, Dr. Mallick will elaborate.

735
00:54:52,625 --> 00:54:55,086
Thank you.

736
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:59,132
Your Honor, there is no universally efficacious treatment...

737
00:54:59,299 --> 00:55:02,135
...for Dissociative Identity Disorder.

738
00:55:02,302 --> 00:55:06,598
In theory, one attempts to move the patient towards integration.

739
00:55:06,764 --> 00:55:11,352
-A folding of their fractured psyche.
-Your Honor?

740
00:55:11,769 --> 00:55:13,229
He's here.

741
00:55:30,622 --> 00:55:33,291
No! What you saw was an accident!

742
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,677
He ran out in front of me!

743
00:55:34,703 --> 00:55:35,652
I'm not a murderer!

744
00:55:35,835 --> 00:55:37,879
There's a dead body in your freezer, Larry.

745
00:55:38,046 --> 00:55:38,958
I didn't kill him.

746
00:55:38,984 --> 00:55:40,615
I found him like that. 
Stop it!

747
00:55:40,757 --> 00:55:44,260
Listen! Listen!
I was in Vegas last month and I lost everything, okay?

748
00:55:44,427 --> 00:55:45,678
Everything!

749
00:55:45,845 --> 00:55:46,571
I drove west.

750
00:55:46,597 --> 00:55:49,499
I didn't know where to go, but I was running on empty...

751
00:55:49,641 --> 00:55:52,060
...so I pulled in here at this place.

752
00:55:52,227 --> 00:55:56,564
And there was no one at the station, so I came over to the office...

753
00:55:56,731 --> 00:55:58,525
...and I walked in.

754
00:55:58,691 --> 00:56:01,569
And there, sitting at that desk right there, was the manager...

755
00:56:01,736 --> 00:56:04,405
...facedown in a Banquet Potpie.
Dead!

756
00:56:04,572 --> 00:56:06,500
Heart attack or something.

757
00:56:06,526 --> 00:56:07,934
Banquet Potpie!

758
00:56:08,076 --> 00:56:10,620
He'd been sitting there for God knows how long.

759
00:56:10,787 --> 00:56:14,833
All of a sudden, this auto-parts salesman pulls up, looking for a room.

760
00:56:14,999 --> 00:56:17,252
I didn't have a fucking dime...

761
00:56:17,418 --> 00:56:20,046
...so I took his 30 and gave him one.

762
00:56:20,213 --> 00:56:24,509
I just took the key from the wall and gave him a room.

763
00:56:24,676 --> 00:56:28,972
Maybe that was wrong, but I was broke, and that's what I did.

764
00:56:30,014 --> 00:56:32,058
Then I came back in here...

765
00:56:32,642 --> 00:56:34,568
...and I moved Larry's body--

766
00:56:34,594 --> 00:56:36,254
His name was Larry too.

767
00:56:36,396 --> 00:56:40,024
I put him in the freezer.

768
00:56:42,652 --> 00:56:44,339
I wasn't trying to hide him.

769
00:56:44,365 --> 00:56:45,388
It was hot out.

770
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:50,160
I thought it was the best place for him
till his family or someone came along.

771
00:56:50,326 --> 00:56:52,829
Only no one did...

772
00:56:53,329 --> 00:56:56,040
...except more guests.

773
00:56:56,249 --> 00:56:59,127
So I checked them in too.

774
00:57:00,044 --> 00:57:02,505
And they all seemed happy...

775
00:57:02,714 --> 00:57:05,341
...so I just stayed.

776
00:57:06,384 --> 00:57:07,396
Cry me a river.

777
00:57:07,422 --> 00:57:09,579
This is a total crock of shit!

778
00:57:09,721 --> 00:57:12,182
-No, it's not!
-Admit it, you killed him!

779
00:57:12,348 --> 00:57:13,572
Just like you killed my con.

780
00:57:13,598 --> 00:57:15,126
Just like you killed her husband.

781
00:57:15,268 --> 00:57:17,038
Just like you killed his actress.

782
00:57:17,064 --> 00:57:17,921
Just admit it.

783
00:57:18,062 --> 00:57:20,227
-Say it, "I killed them." -Stop it!

784
00:57:20,253 --> 00:57:21,799
He can't take any more!

785
00:57:21,941 --> 00:57:23,051
Everything is okay now.

786
00:57:23,077 --> 00:57:24,113
Everything is fine.

787
00:57:24,139 --> 00:57:25,553
We got the guy. It's fine.

788
00:57:25,695 --> 00:57:27,405
-I don't know what we got.
-What?

789
00:57:27,614 --> 00:57:30,074
We thought we got the guy two hours ago, then--

790
00:57:30,241 --> 00:57:31,331
You believe this shit?

791
00:57:31,357 --> 00:57:32,644
It's him! It's this guy!

792
00:57:32,785 --> 00:57:34,913
He had a knife to your neck, remember?

793
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:39,250
His story's so unbelievable, I think it just might be true.

794
00:57:40,043 --> 00:57:41,419
She's got a point.

795
00:57:44,464 --> 00:57:46,633
You guys are crazy.

796
00:57:46,841 --> 00:57:49,093
Maybe it's the burial ground.

797
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:52,138
What?

798
00:57:53,848 --> 00:57:56,194
Read the brochure in there.

799
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:58,044
It's all around us.

800
00:57:58,186 --> 00:58:01,272
A hundred years ago, the government moved these Indians here.

801
00:58:01,439 --> 00:58:04,651
They all died because there was no water.

802
00:58:06,736 --> 00:58:09,155
Now they're coming back to life like sea monkeys, huh?

803
00:58:09,322 --> 00:58:11,282
Come on.
Give me a break, sweetheart.

804
00:58:11,449 --> 00:58:12,515
Just take it easy, Rhodes.

805
00:58:12,541 --> 00:58:13,810
You know, you take it easy!

806
00:58:13,952 --> 00:58:15,958
You've tried to run this show all night.

807
00:58:15,984 --> 00:58:17,689
Giving orders, pointing fingers!

808
00:58:17,831 --> 00:58:20,834
You blamed my con for everything, and he ends up dead.

809
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,342
I'm telling you, it's him!

810
00:58:22,368 --> 00:58:24,070
We all saw him run down George.

811
00:58:24,212 --> 00:58:26,042
Your actress's wallet is right there.

812
00:58:26,068 --> 00:58:27,699
She's dead, there's the wallet.

813
00:58:27,841 --> 00:58:29,107
What more do you want?

814
00:58:29,133 --> 00:58:30,743
Stop it! Please shut up!

815
00:58:31,761 --> 00:58:33,417
All right. You want a plan?

816
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:34,914
Here's the plan, okay?

817
00:58:35,098 --> 00:58:36,236
No one's gonna move.

818
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:39,335
We'll stay here, like this, in this room until dawn.

819
00:58:39,477 --> 00:58:41,646
No one leaves, no one moves.

820
00:58:41,813 --> 00:58:44,816
And if he tries anything, I'm gonna shoot him!

821
00:58:44,941 --> 00:58:48,153
And if something out there comes in here, I'll shoot it!

822
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:51,239
And if anyone of us tries anything, I'll shoot them!

823
00:58:51,406 --> 00:58:52,866
-We get it.
-Good!

824
00:59:26,733 --> 00:59:29,194
Timmy? Timmy?

825
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:31,372
You need to stay in here with us.

826
00:59:31,398 --> 00:59:32,555
It's all right.

827
00:59:39,287 --> 00:59:42,582
Remember that movie where the 10 strangers went to an island...

828
00:59:42,749 --> 00:59:45,126
...and then they all died one by one...

829
00:59:45,293 --> 00:59:49,672
...and then it turned out they weren't strangers, they all had a connection?

830
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:52,091
They all messed with the wrong guy, and he was getting revenge.

831
00:59:52,258 --> 00:59:53,635
Shut up!

832
00:59:55,386 --> 00:59:58,431
I'm just saying maybe there's a connection between all of us.

833
00:59:58,890 --> 01:00:00,225
Like what?

834
01:00:00,809 --> 01:00:03,812
-We're all in Nevada.
-Shut up!

835
01:00:06,481 --> 01:00:09,692
Where were you going with your con when you pulled in here?

836
01:00:11,486 --> 01:00:14,906
Carson City. Okay?

837
01:00:16,407 --> 01:00:18,651
I was going home to Florida.

838
01:00:18,677 --> 01:00:20,520
Where were you going?

839
01:00:20,662 --> 01:00:22,539
I was taking the actress to L.A.

840
01:00:22,872 --> 01:00:24,415
I was born in Florida.

841
01:00:25,542 --> 01:00:28,253
Since you been in that chair, no one's died, so shut up!

842
01:00:28,419 --> 01:00:29,879
No one's died since we've all been here!

843
01:00:30,046 --> 01:00:31,400
Hey, sweetie, sit down.

844
01:00:31,426 --> 01:00:33,074
Where in Florida, Larry?

845
01:00:35,218 --> 01:00:36,494
Where in Florida?

846
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:38,621
Friends now, huh? Great.

847
01:00:39,889 --> 01:00:43,226
-Polk County.
-That's where I was born.

848
01:00:43,393 --> 01:00:45,728
-Which town?
-Mulberry.

849
01:00:45,895 --> 01:00:49,149
-Frostproof.
-No wonder you left.

850
01:00:49,482 --> 01:00:51,568
There's a town called Frostproof?

851
01:00:51,943 --> 01:00:53,398
They grow oranges.

852
01:00:53,424 --> 01:00:55,930
The name doubles as a slogan.

853
01:00:56,072 --> 01:00:58,217
I danced hallelujah the day I left Polk.

854
01:00:58,243 --> 01:00:59,851
Why would you wanna go back?

855
01:00:59,993 --> 01:01:02,954
I found a grove for sale on the Internet.

856
01:01:03,121 --> 01:01:04,928
Nine acres, 1200 trees.

857
01:01:04,954 --> 01:01:06,524
Limes and oranges.

858
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:10,795
According to the realtor, the soil needs a few tills, phosphorous...

859
01:01:11,004 --> 01:01:17,385
...lanes need reading, but it's real good land.

860
01:01:21,431 --> 01:01:23,266
What?

861
01:01:23,892 --> 01:01:25,935
It sounds nice.

902
01:01:46,539 --> 01:01:47,749
Ed?

903
01:01:51,252 --> 01:01:53,463
She's dead.

904
01:02:13,024 --> 01:02:15,485
Get him out of here.

905
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:19,322
Come on.
Come on, sweetie.

906
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:28,498
Look at this.

907
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:37,340
-Where'd you get that?
-Right here.

908
01:02:41,594 --> 01:02:43,722
This doesn't make any sense.

909
01:02:43,748 --> 01:02:45,874
She died from an accident.

910
01:02:46,057 --> 01:02:50,520
George was an accident, if you believe Larry.

911
01:02:53,481 --> 01:02:55,900
Where is seven?

912
01:02:58,570 --> 01:03:00,572
Back it up!

913
01:03:36,816 --> 01:03:39,395
See, I told you it wasn't me!

914
01:03:39,421 --> 01:03:41,554
That's not possible.

915
01:03:41,696 --> 01:03:43,187
I was standing right there.

916
01:03:43,213 --> 01:03:44,402
I saw what happened.

917
01:03:44,428 --> 01:03:45,808
We all saw what happened.

918
01:03:45,950 --> 01:03:49,496
He ran out. Nobody could have known he was gonna do that.

919
01:03:49,662 --> 01:03:50,955
No one human.

920
01:03:51,122 --> 01:03:52,378
We're back to that again?

921
01:03:52,404 --> 01:03:53,608
It's the spirits, huh?

922
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:57,837
Maybe it's the ghost of the guy that Larry put in the freezer.

923
01:03:59,756 --> 01:04:01,716
Somebody untie me.
Goddamn it!

924
01:04:01,883 --> 01:04:03,551
You know it wasn't me.
Come on.

925
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:03,885
-Listen.
-We gotta get out--

926
01:04:03,885 --> 01:04:05,678
-Listen.
-We gotta get out--

927
01:04:05,845 --> 01:04:07,018
Take her car and get out.

928
01:04:07,044 --> 01:04:08,122
You, her and the kid.

929
01:04:08,264 --> 01:04:09,474
There's nowhere to go.

930
01:04:09,641 --> 01:04:11,684
-How much gas do you have?
-Half a tank.

931
01:04:11,851 --> 01:04:13,334
You can drive till dawn on that.

932
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:13,962
Look at me.

933
01:04:14,103 --> 01:04:16,773
When you get to where it's flooded, go the other way.

934
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:18,316
I don't know if I can.

935
01:04:18,483 --> 01:04:21,611
Get the kid and go.
Right now. Come on.

936
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:22,779
Timmy.

937
01:04:22,987 --> 01:04:25,615
Timmy, come on. Let's go.
Get up.

938
01:04:25,782 --> 01:04:26,950
What's going on?

939
01:04:27,116 --> 01:04:28,827
-They can't leave!
-This way.

940
01:04:28,993 --> 01:04:30,995
We'll see you when the storm breaks.

941
01:04:31,162 --> 01:04:32,548
Hey! Hey!
They can't leave!

942
01:04:32,574 --> 01:04:34,524
Where are they going?
Get back here!

943
01:04:34,666 --> 01:04:36,251
Go, go, go!
They're leaving.

944
01:04:36,417 --> 01:04:37,794
-They're not leaving.
-Go!

945
01:04:37,961 --> 01:04:40,672
You can't let suspects leave after four people have been killed!

946
01:04:40,839 --> 01:04:42,575
You really think they're suspects?

947
01:04:42,601 --> 01:04:43,825
They're not leaving!

948
01:04:50,557 --> 01:04:52,058
Shit.

949
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:54,435
Ginny!

950
01:04:56,396 --> 01:04:59,190
Extinguishers.
Larry, you got a fire extinguisher?

951
01:04:59,649 --> 01:05:02,026
-Fire extinguisher! Where?
-Back there!

952
01:05:25,175 --> 01:05:27,093
Nobody in there.

953
01:05:32,474 --> 01:05:35,435
Maybe it got so hot, they got cremated.

954
01:05:35,643 --> 01:05:37,687
There'd be something left.

955
01:05:41,983 --> 01:05:43,359
You did this.

956
01:05:43,985 --> 01:05:44,826
You did this!

957
01:05:44,852 --> 01:05:47,180
You told them to get into the car!

958
01:05:47,322 --> 01:05:48,781
Are you happy?

959
01:06:12,889 --> 01:06:15,058
Where is he?

960
01:07:15,535 --> 01:07:16,703
Nothing.

961
01:07:22,792 --> 01:07:25,128
I give up!

962
01:07:26,171 --> 01:07:28,798
I give up!
What the hell do you want?

963
01:07:29,007 --> 01:07:31,125
What do you want, you sick bastard?

964
01:07:31,151 --> 01:07:33,328
What the fuck do you want from us?

965
01:07:34,929 --> 01:07:38,683
I am turning 30 next week and I just want to go home...

966
01:07:38,850 --> 01:07:40,602
...and grow oranges!

967
01:07:47,484 --> 01:07:50,195
It's your birthday next week?

968
01:07:50,403 --> 01:07:53,281
It's my birthday next week.
The 10th.

969
01:07:54,866 --> 01:07:56,159
Me too.

970
01:08:00,330 --> 01:08:01,789
Me too.

971
01:08:04,584 --> 01:08:06,336
Yeah.

972
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:11,174
George York, May 10.

973
01:08:11,341 --> 01:08:13,301
Alice York, May 10.

974
01:08:13,468 --> 01:08:15,303
Caroline Suzanne, May 10.

975
01:08:16,346 --> 01:08:18,890
Ginny and Lou Isiana, May 10.

976
01:08:19,057 --> 01:08:21,476
Me, Larry Washington, May fucking 10.

977
01:08:22,519 --> 01:08:23,605
What are the odds?

978
01:08:23,631 --> 01:08:25,380
Must be 10 trillion-to-one.

979
01:08:28,024 --> 01:08:29,192
What is it?

980
01:08:44,499 --> 01:08:45,726
Where's the fuse box, Larry?

981
01:08:45,752 --> 01:08:47,110
Other side of the building.

982
01:08:54,259 --> 01:08:56,261
Ginny and Lou Isiana.

983
01:08:56,886 --> 01:08:59,681
Virginia and Louisiana.

984
01:08:59,889 --> 01:09:02,058
Caroline, Carolina.

985
01:09:03,935 --> 01:09:05,937
Paris Nevada.

986
01:09:06,104 --> 01:09:07,730
George York.

987
01:09:08,731 --> 01:09:11,151
Larry Washington.

988
01:09:13,361 --> 01:09:16,281
Rhodes, Rhode Island.

989
01:09:21,870 --> 01:09:24,414
Ed Dakota.

990
01:09:38,553 --> 01:09:43,016
When I was going up the stairs I met a man who wasn't there

991
01:09:43,224 --> 01:09:45,560
He wasn't there again today

992
01:09:45,727 --> 01:09:47,604
I wish
I wish he'd go away

993
01:09:49,397 --> 01:09:51,441
Who is this?

994
01:09:51,608 --> 01:09:54,569
Who am I speaking to right now?

995
01:09:57,322 --> 01:09:59,574
Where did you learn that poem?

996
01:09:59,741 --> 01:10:02,118
Who am I speaking to?
Look at me.

997
01:10:02,285 --> 01:10:04,579
Who am I speaking to right now?

998
01:10:11,169 --> 01:10:12,420
Doc?

999
01:10:15,632 --> 01:10:17,884
-Edward?
-What's happening?

1000
01:10:18,218 --> 01:10:19,072
Please be quiet.

1001
01:10:19,098 --> 01:10:20,912
He can hear what we're saying?

1002
01:10:21,179 --> 01:10:23,598
Of course I can hear what you're fucking saying.

1003
01:10:23,765 --> 01:10:27,130
Edward, you missed your last appointment.

1004
01:10:27,156 --> 01:10:28,878
Where have you been?

1005
01:10:31,022 --> 01:10:32,633
Did I black out again?

1006
01:10:32,659 --> 01:10:34,342
Try and think back.

1007
01:10:34,484 --> 01:10:36,945
Where have you been?

1008
01:10:37,111 --> 01:10:39,781
All right.
I was driving this actress...

1009
01:10:40,281 --> 01:10:43,475
...and we got stuck at the motel.

1010
01:10:43,501 --> 01:10:45,436
There was a storm.

1011
01:10:46,371 --> 01:10:49,040
We couldn't get out because of the storm.

1012
01:10:49,207 --> 01:10:51,376
What happened at the motel?

1013
01:10:54,212 --> 01:10:56,965
People started dying.

1014
01:10:57,131 --> 01:10:58,512
And then their bodies--

1015
01:10:58,538 --> 01:11:00,159
It didn't make any sense.

1016
01:11:00,343 --> 01:11:02,053
They disappeared.

1017
01:11:04,597 --> 01:11:07,267
Edward, I'd like to show something to you, if I may.

1018
01:11:12,564 --> 01:11:15,024
Do you recognize this man?

1019
01:11:16,943 --> 01:11:18,361
No.

1020
01:11:18,987 --> 01:11:21,823
That man, Edward, is Malcolm Rivers.

1021
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:23,664
He's had a very troubled life.

1022
01:11:23,690 --> 01:11:25,643
He was arrested four years ago...

1023
01:11:25,785 --> 01:11:29,122
...and convicted of the murder of six people in a violent rampage.

1024
01:11:29,622 --> 01:11:31,833
-He did this.
-Detective, please.

1025
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,668
Edward, listen to me.

1026
01:11:34,043 --> 01:11:39,966
When faced with an intense trauma, a child's mind may fracture...

1027
01:11:40,133 --> 01:11:43,678
...creating disassociated identities.

1028
01:11:44,512 --> 01:11:47,932
That's exactly what happened to Malcolm Rivers.

1029
01:11:48,099 --> 01:11:50,518
He developed a condition that is commonly known...

1030
01:11:50,685 --> 01:11:53,563
...as Multiple Personality Syndrome.

1031
01:11:58,818 --> 01:12:00,778
Why are you telling me this?

1032
01:12:02,030 --> 01:12:04,282
Because you, Edward...

1033
01:12:04,449 --> 01:12:07,619
...are one of his personalities.

1034
01:12:12,081 --> 01:12:13,708
What?

1035
01:12:28,306 --> 01:12:31,559
Jesus Christ! What the fuck did you do to my face?

1036
01:12:31,768 --> 01:12:33,436
-Keep calm.
-Where is my face?

1037
01:12:33,603 --> 01:12:34,758
That is your face.

1038
01:12:34,784 --> 01:12:36,130
Why am I tied up?

1039
01:12:36,272 --> 01:12:37,899
-Keep calm.
-Where is--?

1040
01:12:38,066 --> 01:12:39,567
-Please.
-Jesus Christ!

1041
01:12:39,776 --> 01:12:41,903
-Where is my face?
-Stay calm.

1042
01:12:42,111 --> 01:12:43,914
No! I'm not gonna stay calm!

1043
01:12:43,940 --> 01:12:45,807
Why am I tied up like this?

1044
01:12:45,949 --> 01:12:47,551
Who are all these people?

1045
01:12:47,577 --> 01:12:49,435
What happened at the motel?

1046
01:12:49,619 --> 01:12:50,808
Where is everybody?

1047
01:12:50,834 --> 01:12:52,647
They don't exist, Edward.

1048
01:12:52,831 --> 01:12:55,416
You were all created by Malcolm as a child.

1049
01:12:55,583 --> 01:12:56,409
You're a liar!

1050
01:12:56,435 --> 01:12:58,027
Consider what you know.

1051
01:12:58,169 --> 01:13:00,547
-Everyone named after a state.
-No.

1052
01:13:00,713 --> 01:13:04,175
Everyone sharing the same birthday.
Your blackouts.

1053
01:13:04,342 --> 01:13:05,802
No! I was a cop!

1054
01:13:05,969 --> 01:13:09,681
I was a cop in the Rampart Division of L.A.P.D. for six years.

1055
01:13:09,889 --> 01:13:10,890
Edward, please.

1056
01:13:11,099 --> 01:13:13,476
I live in Hollywood, in a studio apartment.

1057
01:13:13,643 --> 01:13:14,860
You don't live there.

1058
01:13:14,886 --> 01:13:16,045
I do live there!

1059
01:13:16,271 --> 01:13:18,064
You don't live anywhere.

1060
01:13:18,398 --> 01:13:22,443
I know this is difficult to accept, but the face you saw in that mirror...

1061
01:13:22,610 --> 01:13:27,949
...is the face I've always seen when I talk to Edward or Paris or Larry...

1062
01:13:28,116 --> 01:13:30,034
...or anyone else you've met tonight.

1063
01:13:30,201 --> 01:13:34,164
Malcolm is in the midst of a medical treatment.

1064
01:13:34,330 --> 01:13:39,878
One which forces all his identities to confront one another for the first time.

1065
01:13:40,044 --> 01:13:42,589
I knew there would be violence...

1066
01:13:42,755 --> 01:13:48,011
...and with it, the number of the identities would be reduced.

1067
01:13:50,346 --> 01:13:52,223
Reduced?

1068
01:13:52,390 --> 01:13:55,226
One of the personalities you've met tonight, Edward...

1069
01:13:55,393 --> 01:13:58,271
...committed those murders four years ago.

1070
01:13:58,646 --> 01:14:02,442
He took control of Malcolm's body, as you have now...

1071
01:14:02,609 --> 01:14:05,933
...and released an unspeakable rage.

1072
01:14:05,959 --> 01:14:07,805
And in 19 hours...

1073
01:14:07,989 --> 01:14:11,534
...Malcolm Rivers will be put to death because of those actions...

1074
01:14:11,701 --> 01:14:15,580
...unless I can convince that man...

1075
01:14:15,747 --> 01:14:18,166
...that the killer is gone.

1076
01:14:21,419 --> 01:14:23,880
I need you to stay with me.
Edward?

1077
01:14:24,047 --> 01:14:25,145
I need your help.

1078
01:14:25,171 --> 01:14:27,367
I need your help to finish this.

1079
01:14:27,926 --> 01:14:29,677
Edward, listen to me.

1080
01:14:30,929 --> 01:14:32,597
Edward, stay with me.

1081
01:14:32,764 --> 01:14:33,699
Listen to me.

1082
01:14:33,725 --> 01:14:35,667
I need you to understand.

1083
01:14:35,809 --> 01:14:38,978
The killer cannot survive.

1084
01:14:39,145 --> 01:14:40,438
Edward!

1085
01:15:07,632 --> 01:15:09,175
Got it?

1086
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:11,871
I can't see a thing.

1087
01:15:11,897 --> 01:15:13,830
Is there a flashlight?

1088
01:15:13,972 --> 01:15:15,598
Hang on. Hang on.

1089
01:15:16,099 --> 01:15:17,435
You got a flashlight?

1090
01:15:17,461 --> 01:15:19,878
Yeah, yeah, it's dead. Goddamn it.

1091
01:16:04,647 --> 01:16:06,149
Shut up!

1092
01:16:12,238 --> 01:16:15,033
Hey. What am I supposed to wear, man?

1093
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:16,993
You're in it.

1094
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:29,881
Larry.

1095
01:16:31,674 --> 01:16:34,093
Larry, come here.

1096
01:16:40,517 --> 01:16:42,060
Ed!

1097
01:16:50,527 --> 01:16:52,445
Ed!

1098
01:17:21,057 --> 01:17:22,851
Larry?

1099
01:17:25,979 --> 01:17:28,898
Larry? Larry?

1100
01:17:31,985 --> 01:17:34,737
Where are the keys to the truck?

1101
01:17:34,904 --> 01:17:37,031
Where are the keys to the truck?

1102
01:17:41,161 --> 01:17:42,492
That was good, Larry.

1103
01:17:42,518 --> 01:17:44,355
We gotta get out of here.

1104
01:17:44,497 --> 01:17:46,020
Ed has the keys to the truck.

1105
01:17:46,046 --> 01:17:47,567
I got a spare right here.

1106
01:17:47,709 --> 01:17:48,739
Where is he?

1107
01:17:48,765 --> 01:17:50,737
I don't know. Here.

1108
01:17:51,713 --> 01:17:53,212
What are you doing?

1109
01:17:53,238 --> 01:17:54,657
We need a gun.

1110
01:17:55,717 --> 01:17:56,843
Holy shit!

1111
01:18:00,346 --> 01:18:02,265
Give me the keys to the truck.

1112
01:19:02,367 --> 01:19:04,035
Ed!

1113
01:19:04,202 --> 01:19:06,120
We gotta get out of here!

1114
01:19:06,287 --> 01:19:08,581
-Paris--
-He's coming. He's--

1115
01:19:08,748 --> 01:19:11,084
-Stay here.
-What's wrong with you?

1116
01:19:11,251 --> 01:19:14,003
Paris, listen to me.

1117
01:19:14,170 --> 01:19:16,548
Stay here.

1118
01:19:17,757 --> 01:19:19,968
It's gonna be okay.

1119
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:48,163
Throw me the keys to the truck, Ed.

1120
01:19:50,290 --> 01:19:52,276
Throw me the keys to the truck.

1121
01:19:52,302 --> 01:19:53,902
Stay there. Stay there!

1122
01:20:26,534 --> 01:20:30,288
Ed! Ed! Ed!

1123
01:20:35,585 --> 01:20:38,004
Ed, let me see.

1124
01:20:38,171 --> 01:20:39,881
We gotta get you to a hospital.

1125
01:20:40,089 --> 01:20:42,175
We're gonna get you to a hospital, okay?

1126
01:20:42,342 --> 01:20:45,261
Stay with me because I'm gonna get you to the truck.

1127
01:20:45,428 --> 01:20:47,310
Put your arm around my neck.

1128
01:20:47,336 --> 01:20:49,082
You gotta hold on, okay?

1129
01:20:49,224 --> 01:20:50,905
You with me, Ed?

1130
01:20:50,931 --> 01:20:52,375
Stay with me.

1131
01:20:52,401 --> 01:20:54,921
Okay. One, two, three.

1132
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:57,977
You gotta help me get you up.

1133
01:20:58,003 --> 01:21:00,343
Ed, you gotta push a little bit.

1134
01:21:02,237 --> 01:21:05,615
Ed, why won't you let me help you?

1135
01:21:07,116 --> 01:21:08,743
Where did you go before?

1136
01:21:08,910 --> 01:21:10,541
What did you see?

1137
01:21:10,567 --> 01:21:12,772
Tell me what you saw.

1138
01:21:15,708 --> 01:21:18,294
I saw you.

1139
01:21:22,215 --> 01:21:25,593
I saw you in an orange grove.

1140
01:21:55,498 --> 01:21:58,376
Why won't you let me help you?

1141
01:21:59,502 --> 01:22:01,880
Where did you go?

1142
01:22:02,046 --> 01:22:04,090
What did you see?

1143
01:22:07,427 --> 01:22:09,762
I saw you...

1144
01:22:11,473 --> 01:22:14,809
...in an orange grove.

1145
01:22:51,012 --> 01:22:56,309
The question, Your Honor, is whether to convict the body or the mind.

1146
01:22:56,935 --> 01:23:00,522
His body committed these murders, that is true.

1147
01:23:00,688 --> 01:23:02,982
The person who remains inside did not.

1148
01:23:03,149 --> 01:23:04,692
Judge Taylor, that may not be true--

1149
01:23:04,859 --> 01:23:07,362
We witnessed the destruction of 10 identities tonight.

1150
01:23:07,529 --> 01:23:09,322
Nine were innocent and one was guilty.

1151
01:23:09,489 --> 01:23:10,490
They're not real!

1152
01:23:10,657 --> 01:23:12,951
The violence that existed in him has been executed.

1153
01:23:13,117 --> 01:23:17,789
Your Honor, Malcolm belongs in a state hospital.

1154
01:23:22,168 --> 01:23:26,965
In the matter of Rivers v. Nevada, it is the recommendation of this court...

1155
01:23:27,132 --> 01:23:29,801
...that Mr. Rivers' execution be stayed.

1156
01:23:29,968 --> 01:23:33,805
I am transferring Mr. Rivers to state psychiatric services...

1157
01:23:34,222 --> 01:23:37,142
...under the care of Dr. Mallick.

1158
01:23:55,201 --> 01:23:57,787
Cracked heels and washed-out horns Blow into my face with scorn

1159
01:23:57,954 --> 01:24:02,250
But it's not that way I wasn't born to lose you

1160
01:24:02,417 --> 01:24:04,752
I want you

1161
01:24:04,919 --> 01:24:07,088
I want you

1162
01:24:07,297 --> 01:24:11,509
I want you so bad

1163
01:25:24,165 --> 01:25:25,917
Timmy.

1164
01:25:54,404 --> 01:25:56,197
No, please don't.

1165
01:25:57,615 --> 01:26:01,369
No, Timmy, please.

1166
01:26:01,536 --> 01:26:03,496
What is it, Malcolm?

1167
01:26:12,046 --> 01:26:13,256
Malcolm?

1168
01:26:13,423 --> 01:26:15,633
Whores don't get a second chance.

1169
01:26:33,276 --> 01:26:36,070
When I was going up the stairs

1170
01:26:36,237 --> 01:26:40,074
I met a man who wasn't there

1171
01:26:40,241 --> 01:26:42,952
He wasn't there again today

1172
01:26:43,119 --> 01:26:46,873
I wish I wish he'd go away
