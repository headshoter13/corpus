1
00:00:19,105 --> 00:00:22,691
Hello, my name is Marty
Di Bergi. I'm a filmmaker.

2
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:25,485
I make a lot of commercials.

3
00:00:25,569 --> 00:00:29,030
That little dog that chases the
covered wagon underneath the sink?

4
00:00:29,115 --> 00:00:30,115
That was mine.

5
00:00:31,534 --> 00:00:35,995
In 1966, I went down to
Greenwich Village, New York City,

6
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,997
to a rock club called
The Electric Banana.

7
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:41,376
Don't look for it,
it's not there anymore.

8
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,965
But that night, I heard a band that for
me redefined the word "rock 'n' roll".

9
00:00:47,883 --> 00:00:53,430
I remember being knocked out by
their exuberance, their raw power

10
00:00:53,514 --> 00:00:55,432
and their punctuality.

11
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,436
That band was Britain's
now legendary Spinal Tap.

12
00:01:00,688 --> 00:01:03,940
Seventeen years
and fifteen albums later,

13
00:01:04,024 --> 00:01:06,818
Spinal Tap is
still going strong.

14
00:01:07,194 --> 00:01:09,571
And they've earned a
distinguished place in rock history

15
00:01:09,655 --> 00:01:12,198
as one of
England's loudest bands.

16
00:01:13,117 --> 00:01:15,577
So, in the late fall of 1982,

17
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:19,831
when I heard that Tap was releasing
a new album called Smell the Glove,

18
00:01:19,915 --> 00:01:23,126
and was planning their first tour of
the United States in almost six years

19
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:24,586
to promote that album,

20
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:28,423
well, needless to say, I jumped at
the chance to make the documentary,

21
00:01:28,507 --> 00:01:32,510
the, if you will, rockumentary
that you are about to see.

22
00:01:33,304 --> 00:01:38,057
I wanted to capture the
sights, the sounds, the smells

23
00:01:38,809 --> 00:01:41,519
of a hard-working
rock band on the road.

24
00:01:42,021 --> 00:01:43,521
And I got that.

25
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,732
But I got more.

26
00:01:46,192 --> 00:01:47,609
A lot more.

27
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,403
But, hey, enough of my yacking.

28
00:01:50,488 --> 00:01:52,197
What do you say?
Let's boogie.

29
00:02:02,124 --> 00:02:04,209
Gives me a lot of energy,
makes me happy.

30
00:02:04,293 --> 00:02:06,252
Heavy metal is deep.
You can get stuff out of it.

31
00:02:06,337 --> 00:02:08,296
The way they dress.
The leather.

32
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,131
Which one is this?
Is this LaGuardia...

33
00:02:10,216 --> 00:02:11,966
No, this is JFK.

34
00:02:12,051 --> 00:02:13,593
- Oh, yes.
- New York, New York.

35
00:02:18,224 --> 00:02:19,766
Watch it now.
Watch it now!

36
00:02:31,487 --> 00:02:34,072
It's like you become one
with the guys in the band.

37
00:02:34,156 --> 00:02:37,867
I mean, there's no division,
you just...

38
00:02:38,619 --> 00:02:43,957
The music just unites
people with the players.

39
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:48,461

Let's talk a little bit about
the history of the group.

52
00:04:11,295 --> 00:04:15,173
I understand, Nigel, you and
David originally started the band

53
00:04:15,257 --> 00:04:17,759
back in, when was it, 1964?

54
00:04:17,843 --> 00:04:19,469
Before that, we were
in different groups.

55
00:04:19,553 --> 00:04:21,930
I was in a group called The
Creatures, which was a skiffle group.

56
00:04:22,014 --> 00:04:23,056
I was in Lovely Lads.

57
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,266
And then we
looked at each other

58
00:04:25,351 --> 00:04:28,561
and said, well,
we might as well join up.

59
00:04:29,313 --> 00:04:31,481
- So we became The Originals.
- Right.

60
00:04:31,565 --> 00:04:34,192
And we had to change
our name, actually.

61
00:04:34,318 --> 00:04:37,028
Well, there was another group in
the East End called The Originals.

62
00:04:37,196 --> 00:04:39,447
You know, we had to
rename ourselves.

63
00:04:39,531 --> 00:04:41,074
- New Originals.
- New Originals.

64
00:04:41,158 --> 00:04:43,368
And then they became...
The Regulars.

65
00:04:43,452 --> 00:04:44,953
They changed their name
back to The Regulars.

66
00:04:45,037 --> 00:04:48,539
We thought, well, we could go back to
The Originals, but what's the point?

67
00:04:48,624 --> 00:04:51,000
Then we became
The Thamesmen at that point.

Your first drummer was...

76
00:05:26,328 --> 00:05:28,538
- The Peeper.
- John "Stumpy" Pepys.

77
00:05:28,622 --> 00:05:33,543
Great, great tall,
blonde geek with glasses.

78
00:05:34,712 --> 00:05:36,170
- Good drummer.
- Great look, good drummer, yeah.

79
00:05:36,255 --> 00:05:37,338
- Good, good drummer.
- Fine drummer.

80
00:05:37,423 --> 00:05:39,090
What happened to him?

81
00:05:39,174 --> 00:05:43,928
He died. He died in a bizarre
gardening accident some years back.

82
00:05:44,263 --> 00:05:46,681
It's really one of
those things. It was...

83
00:05:46,765 --> 00:05:52,145
The authorities said best
leave it unsolved, really.

84
00:05:52,604 --> 00:05:54,355
And he was replaced by...

85
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,523
Stumpy Joe.

86
00:05:55,607 --> 00:05:57,275
Eric "Stumpy Joe" Childs.

87
00:05:57,359 --> 00:05:59,027
And what happened
to Stumpy Joe?

88
00:05:59,111 --> 00:06:02,613
Well, it's not
a very pleasant story, but...

89
00:06:03,282 --> 00:06:05,199
- He's passed on.
- He died...

90
00:06:05,284 --> 00:06:07,035
He choked on...

91
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:11,289
The official explanation
was he choked on vomit.

92
00:06:12,207 --> 00:06:13,291
He passed away.

93
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:16,127
It was actually
someone else's vomit.

94
00:06:16,211 --> 00:06:17,253
It was ugly.

95
00:06:17,337 --> 00:06:18,921
You know, there's no real...

96
00:06:19,006 --> 00:06:22,175
They can't prove whose vomit
it was. They don't have...

97
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:23,217
There's no prints.

98
00:06:23,302 --> 00:06:24,385
...facilities in Scotland Yard.

99
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:26,095
There's no way to print
a spectra-photograph.

100
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,420
You can't really
dust for vomit.

101
00:06:28,474 --> 00:06:30,266
- Here we go.
- Hello.

102
00:06:30,809 --> 00:06:32,727
SoHo, they call this. SoHo.

103
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:34,479
- "So" what?
- SoHo.

104
00:06:40,652 --> 00:06:42,904
- How are you?
- Good to see you.

105
00:06:43,739 --> 00:06:48,367
Ian. Hi, fellas!
How are you doing?

106
00:06:48,494 --> 00:06:49,744
Come over here.

107
00:06:49,828 --> 00:06:50,988
I want you to meet everybody.

108
00:06:50,996 --> 00:06:52,580
Bobbi Flekman.

109
00:06:52,664 --> 00:06:54,082
- Who's that?
- Bobbi Flekman.

110
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,959
- Viv! Come over here, everybody.
- With the record company?

111
00:06:57,044 --> 00:06:58,628
So... Yes, Bobbi Flekman.

112
00:06:58,712 --> 00:07:00,004
Bobbi, of course, how are you?

113
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:01,249
The hostess with the mostess.

114
00:07:01,256 --> 00:07:03,508
- We know, we know.
- You know, you know.

115
00:07:04,051 --> 00:07:06,594
Hi, handsome,
how are you doing?

116
00:07:06,678 --> 00:07:09,555
All right, listen, I want you
to all meet Sir Denis Eton-Hogg.

117
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:11,390
- Now, he's the head of Polymer.
- We know.

118
00:07:11,475 --> 00:07:13,601
You, don't talk so much,
just smile a little. Smile.

119
00:07:13,685 --> 00:07:14,727
Oh, she knows...

120
00:07:14,812 --> 00:07:17,230
Denis, come here!
Come here.

121
00:07:17,314 --> 00:07:20,149
I want you to meet Spinal Tap.
They're our guests of honour.

122
00:07:20,234 --> 00:07:21,275
How very nice to meet you.

123
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,111
Kids, this is
Sir Denis Eton-Hogg.

124
00:07:23,195 --> 00:07:24,320
This is Nigel.

125
00:07:24,404 --> 00:07:25,485
- Yeah, this is Nigel.
- Hi.

126
00:07:25,489 --> 00:07:27,740
Thanks a lot for letting us...

127
00:07:28,408 --> 00:07:31,202
Let's go over here, and we'll
all take a picture together.

128
00:07:31,286 --> 00:07:33,830
Where's Christine?
Where's my photographer?

129
00:07:33,914 --> 00:07:36,457
Come over here, honey.
What's your name? Christine?

130
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:39,043
Okay, right over here.

131
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,504
Good. Good!

132
00:07:41,588 --> 00:07:42,839
He's not into negro music.

133
00:07:42,923 --> 00:07:45,216
No, no, I don't eat that shit.

134
00:07:45,592 --> 00:07:48,261
Guys, you look great.
I mean, you look fantastic.

135
00:07:48,345 --> 00:07:50,012
You would never know
you were almost 40.

136
00:07:50,097 --> 00:07:51,337
I mean,
if I looked this good...

137
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,391
And from the stage, too,
it's amazing, you know.

138
00:07:53,475 --> 00:07:55,226
- I did the Bird.
- Do the Dead Bird.

139
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,936
Change this, get the dwarf
cannolis, the little ones.

140
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:59,312
- All right. I did the Bird.
- Come on! Don't talk back.

141
00:07:59,398 --> 00:08:01,107
Mime is money. Let's go!
Come on, move it!

142
00:08:01,525 --> 00:08:03,985
Now, we here at Polymer,
we're all looking forward

143
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:08,364
to a long and fruitful
relationship with Spinal Tap.

144
00:08:08,615 --> 00:08:12,702
We wish them great success
on their North American tour.

145
00:08:12,786 --> 00:08:17,665
And so say all of us,
"Tap into America!"

146
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:26,090
Excuse me,
are you reading Yes I Can?

147
00:08:26,758 --> 00:08:28,009
Yeah, have you read it?

148
00:08:28,093 --> 00:08:30,595
- Yeah, by Sammy Davis Jr.?
- Yeah.

149
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:33,431
You know what the title
of that book should be?

150
00:08:33,515 --> 00:08:36,350
Yes I Can If Frank
Sinatra Says It's Okay.

151
00:08:37,561 --> 00:08:40,354
'Cause Frank calls the
shots for all those guys.

152
00:08:40,439 --> 00:08:44,192
Did you get to the part yet where
Sammy's coming out of the Copa,

153
00:08:44,276 --> 00:08:48,446
and it's about 3:00 in the
morning, and he sees Frank?

154
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:51,365
Frank's walking down
Broadway by himself...

155
00:08:53,952 --> 00:08:55,494
Fucking limeys.

156
00:08:56,288 --> 00:08:57,872
Well, they're not
used to that world.

157
00:08:57,956 --> 00:08:59,165
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, I know.

158
00:08:59,249 --> 00:09:01,918
Frank Sinatra. It's a
different world that they're in.

159
00:09:02,002 --> 00:09:04,754
It's just, people like this,

160
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:07,173
you know, they get all they want,

161
00:09:07,257 --> 00:09:10,676
so they don't really understand
about a life like Frank's.

162
00:09:10,761 --> 00:09:14,305
I mean, when you've loved
and lost the way Frank has,

163
00:09:14,431 --> 00:09:16,515
then you know
what life's about.

164
00:09:16,642 --> 00:09:18,559
- The Times may even do something.
- Really?

165
00:09:18,644 --> 00:09:20,728
- The New York Times?
- The New York Times.

166
00:09:20,812 --> 00:09:23,606
The bump we've got to iron out here
is when do we get the album released?

167
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:26,108
I mean, it doesn't matter how good
the press is or what the stringers...

168
00:09:26,193 --> 00:09:27,902
As I explained last night,

169
00:09:27,986 --> 00:09:31,072
we're not gonna saturate
the New York market.

170
00:09:31,156 --> 00:09:33,324
Now, Philly, now that's
a real rock 'n' roll town.

171
00:09:33,408 --> 00:09:34,575
Oh, Philly's a great town.

172
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,869
Be assured that the
album will be available

173
00:09:36,954 --> 00:09:39,413
all through the Philadelphia
metropolitan area.

174
00:09:39,498 --> 00:09:40,915
So you are hitting that market.

175
00:09:40,999 --> 00:09:43,918
We're certainly doing...

176
00:09:44,002 --> 00:09:46,254
I'm doing everything I can.

177
00:09:46,338 --> 00:09:47,588
You know that
we're not blaming you.

178
00:09:47,673 --> 00:09:50,091
But you don't feel that these
guys have an effect on an audience.

179
00:09:50,175 --> 00:09:53,010
I mean, kids go to their
concert, they have a great time...

180
00:09:53,095 --> 00:09:56,389
But it's a passing thing. It's...

181
00:09:57,683 --> 00:10:02,687
I mean, I would never tell
them this, but this is a fad.

Let's talk about your
reviews a little bit.

205
00:12:06,061 --> 00:12:07,603
Regarding Intravenus de Milo,

206
00:12:07,687 --> 00:12:10,189
"This tasteless cover
is a good indication

207
00:12:10,273 --> 00:12:12,775
"of the lack of
musical invention within.

208
00:12:12,859 --> 00:12:16,320
"The musical growth rate of
this band cannot even be charted.

209
00:12:16,405 --> 00:12:20,408
"They're treading water in a sea of
retarded sexuality and bad poetry."

210
00:12:20,492 --> 00:12:21,951
That's nitpicking, isn't it?

211
00:12:22,035 --> 00:12:24,370
The Gospel According to Spinal Tap.

212
00:12:24,454 --> 00:12:27,748
"This pretentious, ponderous
collection of religious rock psalms

213
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,126
"is enough to prompt
the question,

214
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:33,170
"'What day did
the Lord create Spinal Tap,

215
00:12:33,255 --> 00:12:36,173
"'and couldn't he have
rested on that day, too?"'

216
00:12:36,258 --> 00:12:39,218
I never heard that one. That's
a good one. That's a good one.

217
00:12:39,302 --> 00:12:40,636
The review you had
on Shark Sandwich,

218
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,764
which was merely
a two-word review,

219
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,225
it just said,
"Shit sandwich."

220
00:12:47,811 --> 00:12:49,451
- Where'd they print that?
- Who printed that?

221
00:12:49,521 --> 00:12:51,441
- That's not real, is it?
- You can't print that.

222
00:12:52,732 --> 00:12:55,317
<i>You know, all those arguments
about touring or not touring,</i>

223
00:12:55,402 --> 00:12:57,778
<i>and all that, I mean, it's
obvious, we belong on tour.</i>

224
00:12:57,863 --> 00:12:59,864
<i>- You know, it's a great idea.
- I couldn't agree more.</i>

225
00:12:59,948 --> 00:13:01,115
<i>You know all that stuff
about you being too old</i>

226
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:02,324
<i>- and you being too white...
- Yeah.</i>

227
00:13:02,409 --> 00:13:04,618
But what about the album, Ian?

228
00:13:04,703 --> 00:13:05,744
Well, that's
the real problem...

229
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:07,246
There's beginning
to be a refrain here.

230
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:11,083
You know, there's no way to promote
something that doesn't exist, you know?

231
00:13:11,168 --> 00:13:12,626
It's a very unimportant reason.

232
00:13:12,711 --> 00:13:15,546
It's just that they're just
experimenting with a...

233
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,381
With some new
packaging materials.

234
00:13:17,549 --> 00:13:18,757
Right, let me get the door.

235
00:13:18,842 --> 00:13:20,801
What kind of experimenting? They
got monkeys opening it or what?

236
00:13:20,886 --> 00:13:23,971
The other thing is that the
Boston gig has been cancelled.

237
00:13:24,055 --> 00:13:25,055
- What?
- Yeah.

238
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,641
I wouldn't worry about it, though,
it's not a big college town.

239
00:13:30,562 --> 00:13:33,439
Hey, I heard you boys had an
album coming out right now?

240
00:13:33,523 --> 00:13:35,941
Yeah, it's Smell the
Glove. It should be out now...

241
00:13:36,026 --> 00:13:38,194
- Smell the Glove?
- Smell the Glove, yeah.

242
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:40,696
It's a provocative title.
I love it.

243
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,364
Wait til you see the cover,
wait til you see the cover.

244
00:13:42,449 --> 00:13:43,908
Very provocative indeed.

245
00:13:43,992 --> 00:13:46,869
Bobbi, can I tear
you away from all this?

246
00:13:48,497 --> 00:13:49,497
Do you have a drink?

247
00:13:49,581 --> 00:13:51,373
No, I don't...
I don't really need one, but

248
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:54,001
listen, I really do
have to talk to you a bit

249
00:13:54,085 --> 00:13:55,336
about this whole
issue of the...

250
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,505
Ian, just tell me
whatever's on your mind.

251
00:13:57,589 --> 00:13:59,131
The issue of the cover.

252
00:13:59,216 --> 00:14:00,966
- Yeah?
- Um...

253
00:14:01,134 --> 00:14:05,137
We... I mean, we feel,
and it seems to be facts, that

254
00:14:05,472 --> 00:14:07,640
the company is rather down
on the cover. Is that the case?

255
00:14:07,766 --> 00:14:09,725
- Yes.
- You can give it to me straight, you know.

256
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:11,852
Listen, they don't
like the cover.

257
00:14:11,937 --> 00:14:13,437
- They don't like the cover.
- That's certainly straight.

258
00:14:13,522 --> 00:14:16,106
They find it very offensive
and very sexist.

259
00:14:16,191 --> 00:14:17,792
Well, what exactly
do you find offensive?

260
00:14:17,859 --> 00:14:22,029
- Ian, you put a greased, naked woman...
- I mean, what's offensive?

261
00:14:22,155 --> 00:14:23,447
- on all fours...
- Yes.

262
00:14:23,573 --> 00:14:25,533
- with a dog collar around her neck...
- With a dog collar.

263
00:14:25,617 --> 00:14:27,117
- and a leash...
- And a leash.

264
00:14:27,202 --> 00:14:29,119
and a man's arm, extended out,

265
00:14:29,204 --> 00:14:31,455
up to here,
holding on to the leash

266
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:35,292
and pushing a black glove
in her face to sniff it.

267
00:14:35,418 --> 00:14:37,044
- You don't find that offensive?
- No, I don't.

268
00:14:37,128 --> 00:14:38,212
You don't find that sexist?

269
00:14:38,296 --> 00:14:39,672
This is 1982, Bobbi, come on.

270
00:14:39,756 --> 00:14:42,049
That's right, it's 1982.
Get out of the '60s.

271
00:14:42,133 --> 00:14:44,426
We don't have this mentality
anymore. Listen to me.

272
00:14:44,511 --> 00:14:45,928
Well, you should've seen
the cover they wanted to do.

273
00:14:45,971 --> 00:14:47,388
- I don't care...
- It wasn't a glove, believe me.

274
00:14:47,472 --> 00:14:48,472
See, now this is
something, Ian,

275
00:14:48,557 --> 00:14:50,182
that you're going to have
to talk to your boys about.

276
00:14:50,267 --> 00:14:53,394
- We're certainly not laying down any conditions.
- And I don't think a sexy cover is the answer

277
00:14:53,478 --> 00:14:55,062
for why an album sells
or doesn't sell.

278
00:14:55,146 --> 00:14:58,399
Because, you tell me, The
White Album, what was that?

279
00:14:58,483 --> 00:15:00,044
There was nothing on
that goddamn cover.

280
00:15:01,152 --> 00:15:02,653
- Excuse me, the phone's ringing.
- Sure.

281
00:15:02,737 --> 00:15:03,904
Ian, we'll talk
about this after.

282
00:15:03,989 --> 00:15:05,072
Okay, right, love.

283
00:15:05,156 --> 00:15:06,448
Hello?

284
00:15:06,575 --> 00:15:07,950
Hi, Denis.

285
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,202
Uh-oh.

286
00:15:10,287 --> 00:15:12,621
Okay. Why don't you tell him?

287
00:15:12,998 --> 00:15:14,540
Okay, hold on one minute.

288
00:15:14,624 --> 00:15:15,708
Ian?

289
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,751
It's Eaton-Hogg.
He wants to talk to you.

290
00:15:17,836 --> 00:15:18,836
Okay. Thank you, darling.

291
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,713
You're welcome, dear.

292
00:15:22,132 --> 00:15:23,966
Hello, Sir Denis?

293
00:15:24,301 --> 00:15:25,843
Hi, how are you?

294
00:15:28,888 --> 00:15:30,014
Oh!

295
00:15:31,433 --> 00:15:33,183
Fucking old poofter!

296
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:37,771
But it's really not that
offensive, Sir Denis, come on.

297
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:42,526
Okay. I'll call you absolutely
first thing in the morning.

298
00:15:44,571 --> 00:15:45,904
Oh, shit!

299
00:15:46,281 --> 00:15:48,616
They're not going
to release the album,

300
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,869
because they have decided
that the cover is sexist.

301
00:15:52,537 --> 00:15:53,912
- Well, so what?
- Yeah.

302
00:15:53,997 --> 00:15:55,997
What's wrong with being sexy?
I mean, there's no...

303
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,625
- Sexist!
- "...ist".

304
00:15:57,751 --> 00:15:59,627
- They wanted sexy.
- Okay, listen, I wanted to tell you this,

305
00:15:59,711 --> 00:16:01,211
and I was holding back,

306
00:16:01,296 --> 00:16:03,797
because I didn't know what
Denis' decision was going to be.

307
00:16:03,882 --> 00:16:06,634
But, at this point, both
Sears and Kmart stores have

308
00:16:06,718 --> 00:16:08,218
refused to handle the album.

309
00:16:08,303 --> 00:16:10,929
They're boycotting the album
only because of the cover.

310
00:16:11,014 --> 00:16:13,098
- If the first album was a hit...
- If a company's behind an album,

311
00:16:13,183 --> 00:16:15,225
it can shove it
right down their throats.

312
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,728
Money talks and bullshit walks.

313
00:16:17,812 --> 00:16:19,605
And if the first
album was a hit,

314
00:16:19,689 --> 00:16:20,981
then we could've
pressed on them,

315
00:16:21,066 --> 00:16:22,316
then we could've told them,

316
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,776
- "Yes, let's..."
- The music, every cut,

317
00:16:23,902 --> 00:16:25,819
- on this album is a hit.
- I don't give a shit what the album...

318
00:16:25,904 --> 00:16:27,863
- It's a matter of compromise.
- It was a joke.

319
00:16:27,947 --> 00:16:30,074
- And they're making it a big deal.
- Yeah, that's it. That's true.

320
00:16:30,158 --> 00:16:31,367
You know, if we were
serious, and we said,

321
00:16:31,451 --> 00:16:34,328
"Yes, she should be forced
to smell the glove,"

322
00:16:34,412 --> 00:16:36,997
then you'd have a point, you know,
but it's all a joke, isn't it?

323
00:16:37,082 --> 00:16:38,999
- I mean, it's making fun...
- Well, it is and it isn't.

324
00:16:39,084 --> 00:16:40,167
We're making fun of
that sort of thing.

325
00:16:40,251 --> 00:16:41,669
She should be made
to smell it, you know?

326
00:16:41,753 --> 00:16:43,671
Not, you know, over
and over again, of course.

327
00:16:43,755 --> 00:16:45,506
Listen, the thing is, we can
probably work something out.

328
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:48,342
I'll talk to Denis and maybe we
can come up with a compromise.

329
00:16:48,426 --> 00:16:50,844
A new design concept
that we can all live with.

330
00:16:51,262 --> 00:16:52,302
You guys were schoolmates?

331
00:16:52,305 --> 00:16:56,225
We don't... We're not
university material.

332
00:16:56,309 --> 00:16:58,143
- What's that on your finger?
- It's my gum.

333
00:16:58,228 --> 00:16:59,478
What are you doing
with it on your finger?

334
00:16:59,562 --> 00:17:01,355
I might need it later.

335
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,941
Put it on the table,
that's terrible.

336
00:17:04,025 --> 00:17:05,651
I might forget it on the table.

337
00:17:05,777 --> 00:17:08,445
- How old were you guys when you met?
- I can't take him anywhere.

338
00:17:09,531 --> 00:17:11,865
<i>About eight years old.
Eight or nine.</i>

339
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:14,618
<i>You were eight and I was seven.</i>

340
00:17:14,703 --> 00:17:15,786
<i>That's right, yeah.</i>

341
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:19,790
<i>Do you remember the first song
that you guys ever wrote together?</i>

342
00:17:19,874 --> 00:17:21,709
<i>All The Way Home, probably.</i>

343
00:17:21,793 --> 00:17:22,833
- Yeah.
- All The Way Home?

344
00:17:22,836 --> 00:17:25,546
- Yeah.
- Can you remember a little bit of it?

345
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,965
- I'd love to hear it.
- Christ.

346
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:29,550
With some black coffee
maybe we could do it.

347
00:17:29,634 --> 00:17:30,884
How does it go?

348
00:17:32,637 --> 00:17:35,514
♪ I was standing there beside the railroad track ♪

349
00:17:36,808 --> 00:17:39,977
♪ And I'm waiting for that train
To bring you back ♪

350
00:17:40,186 --> 00:17:41,645
♪ Bring you back ♪

351
00:17:43,648 --> 00:17:49,486
♪ If she's not on the 5:19
Then I'm gonna know what sorrow means ♪

352
00:17:49,821 --> 00:17:53,282
♪ And I'm gonna cry, cry, cry
All the way home ♪

353
00:17:54,159 --> 00:17:56,535
♪ All the way home ♪

354
00:17:56,619 --> 00:17:58,996
♪ All the way home
All the way home ♪

355
00:18:00,623 --> 00:18:02,916
Cry, cry, cry
all the way home...

356
00:18:03,334 --> 00:18:06,128
It's fairly simple. It's about six
words in the whole song, you know.

357
00:18:06,254 --> 00:18:07,921
- We just repeat them over and over again.
- Yeah.

358
00:18:08,006 --> 00:18:09,965
Let's talk about
your music today.

359
00:18:10,049 --> 00:18:15,137
One thing that puzzles me is
the make-up of your audience

360
00:18:15,221 --> 00:18:19,433
seems to be, predominantly,
young boys.

361
00:18:20,226 --> 00:18:21,935
Well, it's
a sexual thing, really.

362
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,772
Aside from the identifying
that boys do with us,

363
00:18:24,856 --> 00:18:27,900
there's also like
a reaction to the female...

364
00:18:27,984 --> 00:18:29,651
Of the female to our music.

365
00:18:29,736 --> 00:18:30,819
- What was the way...
- Yeah.

366
00:18:30,904 --> 00:18:32,237
Really, they're quite fearful.

367
00:18:32,322 --> 00:18:33,322
That's my theory.

368
00:18:33,406 --> 00:18:36,158
They see us on stage,
with tight trousers.

369
00:18:36,242 --> 00:18:38,869
We've got, you know,
armadillos in our trousers.

370
00:18:38,953 --> 00:18:41,121
I mean, it's really quite
frightening, the size.

371
00:18:41,206 --> 00:18:43,957
- Yeah.
- And they run screaming.

372
00:18:49,088 --> 00:18:51,173
Ian, can I have a word
with you for a minute?

373
00:18:51,257 --> 00:18:52,466
Yes, of course.

374
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:55,469
Listen, we have problems with the...

375
00:18:55,553 --> 00:18:56,678
What?

376
00:18:56,763 --> 00:18:58,806
...arrangements
backstage.

377
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:01,141
What exactly? What, I mean...

378
00:19:01,226 --> 00:19:02,893
Well, no, there's
some problems here.

379
00:19:02,977 --> 00:19:04,144
I don't even know
where to start.

380
00:19:04,229 --> 00:19:07,022
- All right, this... No, no, no.
- Sound check? What?

381
00:19:07,106 --> 00:19:10,400
This, this... Look, there's
a little problem with the...

382
00:19:10,485 --> 00:19:12,319
Look, this miniature bread,

383
00:19:12,403 --> 00:19:16,448
it's, like, I've been working with
this now for about half an hour.

384
00:19:16,533 --> 00:19:19,827
I can't figure out... Let's
say I want a bite, right?

385
00:19:19,911 --> 00:19:21,328
- I got this...
- You'd like bigger bread?

386
00:19:21,412 --> 00:19:22,955
Exactly. I don't
understand how...

387
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,456
You could just
fold this, though.

388
00:19:24,582 --> 00:19:26,625
- Well, no, then it's half the size.
- I mean, you could fold it.

389
00:19:26,709 --> 00:19:28,502
No, not the bread.
You just fold the meat.

390
00:19:28,586 --> 00:19:31,421
- Yeah, but then it breaks apart.
- No, no, no.

391
00:19:31,506 --> 00:19:33,048
You put it on the bread
like this, see?

392
00:19:33,132 --> 00:19:35,467
But then if you keep folding
it, it keeps breaking...

393
00:19:35,552 --> 00:19:37,052
But why would you
keep folding it?

394
00:19:37,136 --> 00:19:40,514
...and everything has to be
folded, and then it's this.

395
00:19:40,598 --> 00:19:43,433
And I don't want this,
I want large bread,

396
00:19:43,518 --> 00:19:45,310
so that I can put this...

397
00:19:45,395 --> 00:19:46,520
Right.

398
00:19:46,604 --> 00:19:49,147
...so then it's like this.
But this doesn't work,

399
00:19:49,232 --> 00:19:50,649
because then it's all...

400
00:19:50,733 --> 00:19:52,067
Because it hangs out like that.

401
00:19:52,151 --> 00:19:54,194
Look, would you be
holding this?

402
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:56,029
No, I wouldn't want to
put that in my mouth.

403
00:19:56,114 --> 00:19:58,240
- All right, A. Exhibit A.
- No, you're right.

404
00:19:58,324 --> 00:20:01,827
And then we move onto this.
Look. Who's in here? No one.

405
00:20:01,911 --> 00:20:04,538
And then in here,
there's a little guy. Look.

406
00:20:04,622 --> 00:20:06,123
So it's a complete catastrophe!

407
00:20:06,207 --> 00:20:07,332
No, you're right.
Nigel, Nigel...

408
00:20:07,417 --> 00:20:09,001
But calm down. Calm down.

409
00:20:09,085 --> 00:20:10,210
- Calm...
- No, it's no big deal.

410
00:20:10,295 --> 00:20:11,795
- It's a joke, really.
- I'm sorry.

411
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,214
It's just some cracker
university, you know?

412
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:15,591
- No, it's a joke.
- No, I really...

413
00:20:15,675 --> 00:20:17,217
I don't want it to affect
your performance. All right?

414
00:20:17,302 --> 00:20:19,094
It's not going to
affect my performance.

415
00:20:19,178 --> 00:20:20,929
Don't worry about it,
all right?

416
00:20:21,014 --> 00:20:22,055
I just hate it, really.

417
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,307
- It does disturb me.
- It won't happen again.

418
00:20:23,391 --> 00:20:25,475
But I'll rise above it,
I'm a professional.

419
00:20:30,815 --> 00:20:33,692
♪ It's better in a hell hole ♪

420
00:20:33,776 --> 00:20:37,821
♪ You know where you stand
In a hell hole ♪

421
00:20:37,906 --> 00:20:42,117
♪ Folks lend a hand

♪ Girl, get me back

Do Stonehenge!

424
00:21:42,762 --> 00:21:45,430
Do you actually
play all these, or...

425
00:21:46,349 --> 00:21:48,642
Well, I play them
and I cherish them.

426
00:21:48,726 --> 00:21:51,478
This is at the top of the heap, right
here. There's no question about it.

427
00:21:51,562 --> 00:21:54,940
Look at the flame on that
one. I mean, it's just...

428
00:21:55,024 --> 00:21:56,817
It's quite unbelievable.

429
00:21:56,901 --> 00:22:02,864
This one is just perfect.
1959, you cannot...

430
00:22:02,949 --> 00:22:05,701
- How much...
- Listen, just listen for a minute.

431
00:22:05,785 --> 00:22:07,077
The sustain, listen to it.

432
00:22:07,161 --> 00:22:08,745
I'm not hearing anything.

433
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:11,164
You would, though,
if it were playing,

434
00:22:11,249 --> 00:22:14,084
because it really is
famous for its sustain.

435
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:15,335
You can just hold it...

436
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,586
So you'd have to play...

437
00:22:17,797 --> 00:22:19,214
You can go and
have a bite and...

438
00:22:20,591 --> 00:22:21,831
You'd still be
hearing that one.

439
00:22:21,884 --> 00:22:23,510
- Can you hold this a sec?
- Sure.

440
00:22:23,594 --> 00:22:27,639
This one... This, of course,
is a custom three-pick-up Paul.

441
00:22:27,932 --> 00:22:29,891
This is my radio unit.

442
00:22:29,976 --> 00:22:34,896
So I strap this piece on, right
down in here when I'm on stage.

443
00:22:34,981 --> 00:22:37,149
- It's a wireless.
- Wireless, exactly.

444
00:22:37,567 --> 00:22:39,776
And I can play without
all the mucky-muck.

445
00:22:39,902 --> 00:22:41,528
- You can run anywhere on stage with that.
- Exactly.

446
00:22:41,612 --> 00:22:44,698
Now, this is special, too.
Look. See?

447
00:22:44,782 --> 00:22:47,868
Still got the old tagger on
it, see? Never even played it.

448
00:22:47,952 --> 00:22:49,313
- You just bought it?
- Don't touch it!

449
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:51,330
- Don't touch it. No one...
- I wasn't gonna touch it.

450
00:22:51,414 --> 00:22:53,215
- No. Don't touch it.
- I was just pointing at it.

451
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:55,292
- Well, don't point, even.
- Don't even point?

452
00:22:55,376 --> 00:22:57,794
No. It can't be
played. Never.

453
00:22:57,879 --> 00:22:59,171
Can I look at it?

454
00:22:59,255 --> 00:23:00,714
No, you've seen
enough of that one.

455
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:04,760
This is a top to what we use
on stage, but it's very special,

456
00:23:04,844 --> 00:23:07,054
- because if you can see...
- Yeah.

457
00:23:07,138 --> 00:23:10,182
...the numbers all go to 11.

458
00:23:10,266 --> 00:23:13,643
Look, right across
the board, 11, 11, 11...

459
00:23:13,728 --> 00:23:15,854
And most of these
amps go up to 10.

460
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:16,938
Exactly.

461
00:23:17,023 --> 00:23:19,399
Does that mean it's louder?
Is it any louder?

462
00:23:19,484 --> 00:23:22,652
Well, it's one louder,
isn't it? It's not 10.

463
00:23:23,071 --> 00:23:25,697
You see, most blokes
will be playing at 10.

464
00:23:25,782 --> 00:23:28,950
You're on 10 here, all
the way up, all the way up,

465
00:23:29,035 --> 00:23:32,996
you're on 10 on your guitar,
where can you go from there? Where?

466
00:23:33,206 --> 00:23:34,831
- I don't know.
- Nowhere. Exactly!

467
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:36,833
What we do is, if we need that

468
00:23:36,918 --> 00:23:39,711
extra push over the cliff,
you know what we do?

469
00:23:39,796 --> 00:23:42,172
- Put it up to 11.
- 11! Exactly. One louder.

470
00:23:42,256 --> 00:23:45,926
Why don't you just make 10 louder,
and make 10 be the top number,

471
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:48,220
and make that a little louder?

472
00:23:50,681 --> 00:23:51,807
These go to 11.

473
00:23:52,517 --> 00:23:54,142
Are you Spinal Tap?

474
00:23:54,227 --> 00:23:55,268
- Spinal Tap?
- This is Spinal Tap.

475
00:23:55,353 --> 00:23:56,937
Tap, tap, tap, tap.
Welcome to Memphis, gentlemen.

476
00:23:57,021 --> 00:23:59,815
We have a slight problem with your
reservation. Nothing serious, I'm afraid.

477
00:23:59,899 --> 00:24:00,899
How slight?

478
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:02,609
You wanted seven suites, yes.

479
00:24:02,693 --> 00:24:03,693
Seven suites.

480
00:24:03,778 --> 00:24:06,947
He mistakenly put you on the
seventh floor, with one suite.

481
00:24:07,031 --> 00:24:09,282
That's considerably
more than minor.

482
00:24:09,367 --> 00:24:13,286
But it's a good size room, sir, it's
a King Leisure. We can get you...

483
00:24:13,371 --> 00:24:16,790
How are we gonna get 14 people
in a King Leisure bed, Tucker?

484
00:24:16,874 --> 00:24:18,792
- Don't tempt me, sir.
- Have a good time, will you? Take care.

485
00:24:18,876 --> 00:24:19,918
I'll take care of it.

486
00:24:20,002 --> 00:24:22,295
You're welcome, gentlemen. And
very attractive, they are, too.

487
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,839
- Listen to me!
- Yes, sir.

488
00:24:23,923 --> 00:24:25,843
We want these suites, and
we want them now, okay?

489
00:24:25,925 --> 00:24:27,259
- These people are tired.
- Yes, we can help you.

490
00:24:27,385 --> 00:24:29,302
- We have sound check in an hour.
- Reba! Perhaps you can help us.

491
00:24:29,387 --> 00:24:30,720
- What's the problem, sir?
- Give me a hand, please.

492
00:24:30,805 --> 00:24:32,389
- What's the matter?
- I'll tell you what's wrong, okay?

493
00:24:32,473 --> 00:24:35,350
This twisted old
fruit here tells me

494
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:38,221
- that you have not got my reservations.
- I'm just as God made me, sir.

495
00:24:38,229 --> 00:24:40,438
What's the difference between
golf and miniature golf?

496
00:24:40,523 --> 00:24:42,232
I think the balls...
The holes are smaller.

497
00:24:42,316 --> 00:24:44,484
Uh-oh! Look out,
here they come.

498
00:24:44,569 --> 00:24:45,986
Duke, Duke!

499
00:24:47,822 --> 00:24:48,862
Can I have your autograph?

500
00:24:48,906 --> 00:24:49,990
It's Duke Fame!
It's Duke Fame.

501
00:24:50,074 --> 00:24:51,992
Duke! Duke.

502
00:24:52,076 --> 00:24:53,702
It's okay, we know him.
Spinal Tap.

503
00:24:53,786 --> 00:24:56,163
David St. Hubbins,
Spinal Tap.

504
00:24:56,247 --> 00:24:58,123
- Derek Smalls, Spinal Tap.
- Nigel...

505
00:24:58,207 --> 00:24:59,207
We gotta get going...

506
00:24:59,292 --> 00:25:00,625
Listen, where are
you playing in town?

507
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,627
- You playing here?
- We're doing the...

508
00:25:02,712 --> 00:25:04,504
Enormodome, whatever
it is, it's terrific.

509
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,298
Yeah, big place, outside of
town. Sold it out. Very nice.

510
00:25:06,382 --> 00:25:07,674
That's a big place.
You sold it out?

511
00:25:07,758 --> 00:25:08,967
What's that?
20,000 seats?

512
00:25:09,051 --> 00:25:10,844
We really should run,
you know...

513
00:25:10,928 --> 00:25:13,555
Good heavens!
How are you, laddy?

514
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:15,307
Great to see you, Ter.

515
00:25:15,391 --> 00:25:17,058
- Terrific to see you.
- Liam!

516
00:25:17,143 --> 00:25:18,935
- Ian. Ian.
- Ian, yeah.

517
00:25:19,312 --> 00:25:21,104
Listen, we'd love to
stand around and chat,

518
00:25:21,189 --> 00:25:23,690
but we gotta sit down in the
lobby and wait for the limo.

519
00:25:23,774 --> 00:25:25,817
Okay. Duke, great to see you.
Catch up with you on the road.

520
00:25:25,943 --> 00:25:27,569
- Great to see you again, Terry.
- Yeah, cheers!

521
00:25:27,653 --> 00:25:28,653
- Best of luck.
- Duke!

522
00:25:28,738 --> 00:25:29,738
We'll catch up
at your house, maybe.

523
00:25:29,822 --> 00:25:31,781
Great! Great!
Great to see you.

524
00:25:31,866 --> 00:25:33,658
- See you. See you, Duke.
- Good days, good days.

525
00:25:35,077 --> 00:25:36,703
- Wanker.
- What a wanker.

526
00:25:36,787 --> 00:25:37,913
- What a wanker.
- No-talent sod.

527
00:25:37,997 --> 00:25:40,290
He's got this much talent.
This much, if he's lucky.

528
00:25:40,374 --> 00:25:41,416
We carried him.

529
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,101
We had to apologize
for him with our set.

530
00:25:43,127 --> 00:25:44,169
That's right.

531
00:25:44,253 --> 00:25:46,254
People were still
booing him when we went on.

532
00:25:46,339 --> 00:25:48,048
- It's all bull.
- It's all hype.

533
00:25:48,132 --> 00:25:50,342
We got our rooms.
Big fat suites.

534
00:25:50,426 --> 00:25:51,551
Can I ask you something?

535
00:25:51,636 --> 00:25:54,429
Have you seen Duke Fame's
current album?

536
00:25:55,223 --> 00:25:56,598
Um... Yes, yes.

537
00:25:56,682 --> 00:25:58,266
Have you seen the cover?

538
00:25:58,351 --> 00:25:59,559
No, I don't think I have.

539
00:25:59,644 --> 00:26:00,727
It's a rather lurid cover.

540
00:26:00,811 --> 00:26:03,313
I mean, it's like
naked women, and...

541
00:26:03,397 --> 00:26:06,858
He's tied down to this table,
and they've got these whips,

542
00:26:06,984 --> 00:26:09,319
- and they're all semi-nude...
- Knocking on him.

543
00:26:09,403 --> 00:26:10,904
- And it's like... It's much worse...
- What's the point?

544
00:26:10,988 --> 00:26:12,906
Well, the point is that it's
much worse than Smell the Glove.

545
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:15,450
He releases that,
and he's number three!

546
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:16,826
Because he's the victim.

547
00:26:16,911 --> 00:26:19,204
Their objections were that
she was the victim, you see.

548
00:26:19,288 --> 00:26:20,288
- Oh.
- Oh.

549
00:26:20,373 --> 00:26:23,083
That's all right. If the singer's the
victim, it's different. It's not sexist.

550
00:26:23,167 --> 00:26:24,209
He did a twist on it.

551
00:26:24,293 --> 00:26:25,460
He did, he turned it around.

552
00:26:25,586 --> 00:26:27,170
- We should have thought of that.
- We were so close.

553
00:26:27,255 --> 00:26:30,215
If we had all you guys tied up,
that probably would have been fine.

554
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:31,716
But it's still a stupid cover.

555
00:26:31,801 --> 00:26:34,636
It's such a fine line
between stupid and clever.

556
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,471
Yeah, just that
little turnabout.

557
00:26:36,555 --> 00:26:38,723
I have a small
piece of bad news.

558
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:40,308
- Although, it may not be that bad.
- For a change.

559
00:26:40,393 --> 00:26:42,352
We're cancelled here.

560
00:26:43,187 --> 00:26:44,187
At the hotel?

561
00:26:44,272 --> 00:26:46,690
No, we're cancelled.
The gig is cancelled.

562
00:26:46,857 --> 00:26:47,983
Fuck.

563
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:52,821
It says, "Memphis show cancelled
due to lack of advertising funds."

564
00:26:53,406 --> 00:26:56,116
The last time
Tap toured America, they were

565
00:26:56,951 --> 00:27:01,413
booked into 10,000-seat
arenas and 15,000-seat venues.

566
00:27:01,998 --> 00:27:04,582
And it seems that now,
on the current tour,

567
00:27:04,667 --> 00:27:09,462
they're being booked into
1,200-seat arenas, 1,500-seat arenas, and

568
00:27:09,714 --> 00:27:13,591
I was just wondering, does this mean
the popularity of the group is waning?

569
00:27:13,676 --> 00:27:15,802
Oh, no!
No, no, no, no, no.

570
00:27:16,554 --> 00:27:19,597
No, not at all.
I just think that

571
00:27:19,682 --> 00:27:22,017
their appeal is
becoming more selective.

572
00:27:22,101 --> 00:27:23,101
Ah.

573
00:27:23,561 --> 00:27:26,021
Now, I notice this here, you
got this cricket bat here.

574
00:27:26,147 --> 00:27:27,397
- Yes.
- Do you play?

575
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:30,066
No, I carry this
partly out of...

576
00:27:30,151 --> 00:27:32,193
I don't know, sort of...

577
00:27:34,488 --> 00:27:36,823
- I suppose, what's the word?
- Affectation?

578
00:27:36,907 --> 00:27:40,493
Yes, I mean, it's a kind of
totemistic thing, you know?

579
00:27:40,578 --> 00:27:42,495
But, to be quite frank
with you,

580
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,331
it's come in useful
on a couple situations.

581
00:27:44,498 --> 00:27:47,667
<i>Certainly, in the topsy-turvy
world of heavy rock,</i>

582
00:27:47,752 --> 00:27:51,921
having a good solid piece of wood
in your hand is quite often useful.

583
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:54,799
I miss you too, darling.

584
00:27:54,967 --> 00:27:57,510
Um... Not too well, actually.

585
00:27:57,595 --> 00:27:59,262
Well, we've got some
cancellations, that's all.

586
00:27:59,347 --> 00:28:01,514
We got to Memphis and
there's no gig in Memphis,

587
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:04,309
and we find out this
promoter in the Midwest

588
00:28:04,393 --> 00:28:07,771
has pulled out
St. Louis and Kansas City

589
00:28:08,272 --> 00:28:11,733
and Des Moines.

590
00:28:12,693 --> 00:28:15,612
I don't know, it's in
Indiana or something.

591
00:28:17,114 --> 00:28:18,490
I thought...

592
00:28:19,533 --> 00:28:21,201
Don't tease me.

593
00:28:21,285 --> 00:28:23,495
That's not until
April. Great!

594
00:28:23,788 --> 00:28:26,414
We'll do it!
Oh, fucking great.

595
00:28:27,792 --> 00:28:30,126
Milwaukee.
Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

596
00:28:30,711 --> 00:28:33,463
I have no idea. You might have
to take a plane to New York,

597
00:28:33,547 --> 00:28:36,299
and then go to
Milwaukee from there.

598
00:28:37,968 --> 00:28:41,054
Oh, God, I love you, too.
Okay, bye.

599
00:28:44,183 --> 00:28:45,544
Well, my problems
are solved, mate.

600
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:46,559
Who's that?

601
00:28:46,644 --> 00:28:48,728
Was Jeanine, she's
gonna come meet us.

602
00:28:48,813 --> 00:28:53,400
She was supposed to do this window
layout for Neil Kite's boutique.

603
00:28:53,818 --> 00:28:54,901
But it's not until April!

604
00:28:54,985 --> 00:28:57,362
Is she coming to drop some stuff
off? You know, and going right back?

605
00:28:57,446 --> 00:28:59,906
No, no. She's coming on her
own. She's gonna travel with us.

606
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,408
She's gonna go on
the road with us.

607
00:29:01,492 --> 00:29:02,575
Turn it up.
Turn it up!

608
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:05,036
She says she can hear that I'm
eating too much sugar on the phone.

609
00:29:05,121 --> 00:29:07,163
She says my larynx is fat.

610
00:29:08,124 --> 00:29:12,627
You might want to come next door.
The radio is playing a bit of your past.

611
00:29:14,213 --> 00:29:15,672
You happy for me?

612
00:29:20,219 --> 00:29:21,469

fucking perspective now.

00:31:20,923 --> 00:31:22,840
In 1967, you...

664
00:31:22,925 --> 00:31:25,927
That was the first time
Spinal Tap came into existence.

665
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:28,388
Well, the whole world was
changing in those days.

666
00:31:28,472 --> 00:31:30,890
- And also we had the world's ear...
- We were changing the world.

667
00:31:30,975 --> 00:31:33,295
...because we had just released
an enormous-selling single.

668
00:31:33,394 --> 00:31:35,728
- Listen to the Flower People.
- Flower People.

669
00:31:35,813 --> 00:31:38,064
We toured the world,
we toured the States...

670
00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:39,691
We toured the world
and elsewhere.

671
00:31:39,775 --> 00:31:40,984
It was a dream come true.

672
00:31:41,068 --> 00:31:42,694

♪ Listen

677
00:32:32,703 --> 00:32:35,538
Now during the Flower People
period, who was your drummer?

678
00:32:35,623 --> 00:32:37,957
Stumpy's replacement,
Peter "James" Bond,

679
00:32:38,042 --> 00:32:40,960
he also died in
mysterious circumstances.

680
00:32:41,045 --> 00:32:43,129
- We were playing a...
- Festival.

681
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:44,756
...jazz-blues festival.
Where was that?

682
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,716
- Blues-jazz, really.
- Blues-jazz festival.

683
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,302
It was the Isle...
It was in the Isle of...

684
00:32:49,386 --> 00:32:50,426
- Isle of Lucy.
- Isle of Lucy.

685
00:32:50,471 --> 00:32:52,305
- The Isle of Lucy Jazz-Blues Festival.
- Isle of Lucy.

686
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:56,184
And it was tragic, really.
He exploded on stage.

687
00:32:57,478 --> 00:32:58,478
Just like that.

688
00:32:58,562 --> 00:32:59,604
He just went up.

689
00:32:59,688 --> 00:33:02,315
He just was like a flash of green light,

690
00:33:03,275 --> 00:33:05,109
and that was it.
Nothing was left.

691
00:33:05,194 --> 00:33:06,694
- Look at his face.
- Well, there was.

692
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,820
- It's true, this really did happen.
- It's true.

693
00:33:07,905 --> 00:33:10,823
There was a little green
globule on his drum seat.

694
00:33:10,908 --> 00:33:11,908
Like a stain, really.

695
00:33:11,992 --> 00:33:13,785
It was more of a stain
than a globule, actually, and...

696
00:33:13,869 --> 00:33:16,120
You know, several... You
know, dozens of people

697
00:33:16,205 --> 00:33:18,539
spontaneously
combust each year.

698
00:33:18,624 --> 00:33:20,333
It's just not really widely reported.

699
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:21,668
Right.

700
00:33:23,962 --> 00:33:26,214
- Testing.
- Hello, hello.

701
00:33:26,298 --> 00:33:29,384
Test, test, test. This is mic
number one. This is mic number one.

702
00:33:29,468 --> 00:33:30,510
Isn't this a lot of fun?

703
00:33:30,594 --> 00:33:32,428
- Two, two.
- Okay, got the mics.

704
00:33:32,513 --> 00:33:35,807
Let's do GSM,

Hello, I've got a
surprise for you.

715
00:34:19,518 --> 00:34:21,227
Hey! Where'd
you come from?

716
00:34:21,311 --> 00:34:23,563
Where do you think I came from?

717
00:34:23,647 --> 00:34:25,940
Bloody airplane,
didn't I? Right?

718
00:34:28,986 --> 00:34:33,406
David. David.
David. Come on, David.

719
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:40,246
Feels good. I've been wanting
to do that for the longest time.

720
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:43,666
Want me to carry
you about with me?

721
00:34:43,751 --> 00:34:45,918
- What's all this? Tell me.
- What?

722
00:34:46,003 --> 00:34:47,044
That's the film crew.

723
00:34:47,129 --> 00:34:50,047
I told you about this.
It's the film crew. Martin?

724
00:34:50,132 --> 00:34:51,215
- Hi, Martin.
- This is Jeanine.

725
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,759
- Hello.
- Hello.

726
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,428
- Here it is!
- It's Visitors' Day, isn't it?

727
00:34:55,512 --> 00:34:56,596
Here it is, lads!

728
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,722
We better turn to...

729
00:34:57,806 --> 00:34:59,140
Smell the Glove,
me old beauties!

730
00:34:59,224 --> 00:35:00,266
Oh, really?

731
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,471
Gather around.
Where's David?

732
00:35:01,477 --> 00:35:02,477
Come on, Ian, you're kidding.

733
00:35:02,561 --> 00:35:04,771
David. David,
get up here!

734
00:35:04,855 --> 00:35:08,524
David, Smell the
Glove is here. Hello, Jeanine.

735
00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:10,276
The moment we've all
been waiting for.

736
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,944
I thought I'd never see it.

737
00:35:12,029 --> 00:35:13,946
- Here we go.
- I never thought I'd live to see the day.

738
00:35:14,031 --> 00:35:15,656
Plenty for everybody.

739
00:35:15,741 --> 00:35:16,824
Wait a minute.
A little fanfare.

740
00:35:16,909 --> 00:35:17,950
What do you think?

741
00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:19,327
Is this the test pressing?

742
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:20,912
- No, this is it.
- Yes, that's right.

743
00:35:20,996 --> 00:35:22,580
This is Smell the Glove
by Spinal Tap?

744
00:35:22,664 --> 00:35:24,165
- When you go to the store...
- That's Smell the Glove.

745
00:35:24,249 --> 00:35:27,919
That's the jacket cover that's going
out across the country in every store.

746
00:35:28,045 --> 00:35:29,670
- Is this the compromise you made?
- Yes.

747
00:35:29,755 --> 00:35:31,172
Is it going to say anything
here or along the spine?

748
00:35:31,215 --> 00:35:32,924
- It doesn't even say anything?
- It's not going to say anything.

749
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,634
- It's just going to be all black?
- It's going to be that,

750
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:37,261
simple, beautiful, classic.

751
00:35:37,346 --> 00:35:39,055
Does look like, you know, black leather.

752
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:41,182
You can see yourself
in both sides.

753
00:35:41,266 --> 00:35:42,809
I wouldn't feel so bad...

754
00:35:42,893 --> 00:35:44,644
- It's like a black mirror.
- Yeah, it is.

755
00:35:44,728 --> 00:35:46,437
Well, I think it
looks like death.

756
00:35:46,522 --> 00:35:48,439
It looks like mourning.
I mean, it looks...

757
00:35:48,524 --> 00:35:51,317
David, David, every movie in
every cinema is about death.

758
00:35:51,401 --> 00:35:52,985
Death sells!

759
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,779
I think he's right,
there's something about this

760
00:35:54,863 --> 00:35:58,658
that's so black, it's like,
"How much more black could this be?"

761
00:35:58,742 --> 00:36:02,328
And the answer is,
"None, none more black."

762
00:36:02,412 --> 00:36:04,664
I think you're, like,
rationalizing this whole thing

763
00:36:04,748 --> 00:36:07,750
into something that
you did on purpose.

764
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:10,127
I think we're stuck
with a very, very stupid

765
00:36:10,212 --> 00:36:12,255
and a very
dismal-looking album.

766
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:13,506
This is depressing!

767
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,841
This is something you
wear around your arm,

768
00:36:14,925 --> 00:36:16,092
you don't put this on
your fucking turntable.

769
00:36:16,176 --> 00:36:17,260
David, it's a choice.

770
00:36:17,344 --> 00:36:19,679
I frankly think that this
is the turning point, okay?

771
00:36:19,763 --> 00:36:22,181
I think this is...
We're on our way now.

772
00:36:22,266 --> 00:36:24,600

Tap drummers in the past,

792
00:39:10,892 --> 00:39:14,478
do you have any
fears for your life?

793
00:39:14,563 --> 00:39:16,689
When I did join, you know,
they did tell me.

794
00:39:16,773 --> 00:39:18,649
They kind of took
me aside and said,

795
00:39:18,734 --> 00:39:21,277
"Well, Mick, you know,
it's like this."

796
00:39:21,945 --> 00:39:24,321
<i>And it did kind of
freak me out a bit,</i>

797
00:39:24,406 --> 00:39:27,575
but it can't always
happen to... Can it?

798
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:29,368
Right. Right.

799
00:39:29,453 --> 00:39:30,619
- I mean, really.
- The law of averages says...

800
00:39:30,704 --> 00:39:31,704
The law of averages.

801
00:39:31,788 --> 00:39:33,028
It says you will survive. Yeah.

802
00:39:36,752 --> 00:39:37,835
Whoa.

803
00:39:37,919 --> 00:39:42,339
Quite exciting. Quite
exciting, this computer magic.

804
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,341
Whee!

805
00:39:44,426 --> 00:39:46,552
How many planets
have you destroyed, Viv?

806
00:39:46,636 --> 00:39:50,347
Well, fourth or fifth time round,
I think. We're doing really five.

807
00:39:50,432 --> 00:39:51,849
Few galaxies gone, you know...

808
00:39:54,478 --> 00:39:56,645
- Don't.
- This is Cindy's first moustache.

809
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:57,730
Is it?

810
00:39:59,691 --> 00:40:00,941
Can I take it off now?

811
00:40:01,026 --> 00:40:02,359
Why? Too hot in it?

812
00:40:02,444 --> 00:40:03,819
No, it's...

813
00:40:04,154 --> 00:40:07,239
I thought I might go back to see what
they were up to back there, you know.

814
00:40:07,324 --> 00:40:08,741
Don't think they really
need to see this

815
00:40:08,825 --> 00:40:10,159
until you're finished
with it, you know.

816
00:40:10,243 --> 00:40:13,079
Well, you were reading.
You can read here.

817
00:40:13,497 --> 00:40:17,500
Yeah, but they got the new game
back there. Thought I'd maybe...

818
00:40:18,085 --> 00:40:20,211
Thought I'd have a look at the new game.

819
00:40:20,295 --> 00:40:21,670
It's like a submarine thing.

820
00:40:21,755 --> 00:40:23,798
You've got all this
stuff all over you again.

821
00:40:24,007 --> 00:40:27,676
<i>Before I met Jeanine, my
life was cosmically in shambles.</i>

822
00:40:27,761 --> 00:40:29,929
<i>It was... I was using
bits and pieces</i>

823
00:40:30,013 --> 00:40:31,597
<i>of whatever
Eastern philosophies</i>

824
00:40:31,681 --> 00:40:33,808
<i>happened to drift
through my transom.</i>

825
00:40:33,892 --> 00:40:37,269
And she sort of sorted it out for
me, straightened it out for me.

826
00:40:37,354 --> 00:40:39,438
Gave me a path, you know,
a path to follow.

827
00:40:39,523 --> 00:40:43,275
I wonder if you have as much
influence over his musical expression.

828
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,444
Oh, yeah. I mean,
I listen to him

829
00:40:45,529 --> 00:40:47,613
when he's experimenting
and things like that.

830
00:40:47,697 --> 00:40:48,823
Don't I, doll?

831
00:40:48,907 --> 00:40:51,951
He plays things to me sometimes

832
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:56,247
when he's worked out... When he's got a new bit that he
wants to tell me about, you know,

833
00:40:56,331 --> 00:40:58,251
and I say, "Yeah, that's
good," or, "That's bad,"

834
00:40:58,333 --> 00:40:59,792
or, "That's shit," or whatever.

835
00:40:59,876 --> 00:41:01,127
- Yeah.
- You know.

836
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:04,004
Yes, she's very honest,
she's brutally frank.

837
00:41:04,089 --> 00:41:05,965
Well, how does that go
over with the other band members?

838
00:41:06,049 --> 00:41:07,633
I mean, you...

839
00:41:07,717 --> 00:41:10,553
Well, what happens is, she gives
me the brutally frank version,

840
00:41:10,637 --> 00:41:11,679
and I sort of tart
it up for them.

841
00:41:11,763 --> 00:41:12,763
Yeah.

842
00:41:12,848 --> 00:41:16,809
And of course it's so strange
because Nigel and Jeanine

843
00:41:16,893 --> 00:41:21,147
are so similar in so many
ways, but they just can't...

844
00:41:21,815 --> 00:41:23,649
- They don't dislike each other at all.
- No.

845
00:41:23,733 --> 00:41:25,025
There's a great love
between the two of them.

846
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,318
Oh, yes.

847
00:41:26,403 --> 00:41:27,945
But there's some sort of communication

848
00:41:28,029 --> 00:41:30,865
that's just not... It's
just blocked or something.

849
00:41:46,506 --> 00:41:48,007
It's pretty.

850
00:41:48,091 --> 00:41:49,300
Yeah, I like it.

851
00:41:49,384 --> 00:41:52,678
Just been fooling about
with it for a few months now.

852
00:41:52,762 --> 00:41:54,346
Very delicate.

853
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,682
It's a bit of a departure

854
00:41:56,766 --> 00:41:59,143
from the kind of thing
you normally play.

855
00:41:59,477 --> 00:42:02,229
Yeah, well, it's part
of a trilogy, really,

856
00:42:02,314 --> 00:42:04,231
a musical trilogy
that I'm doing,

857
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:08,444
in D minor, which I always find

858
00:42:08,528 --> 00:42:10,529
is really the saddest
of all keys.

859
00:42:10,614 --> 00:42:13,866
Really. I don't know why, but it makes
people weep instantly, to play a...

860
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,787
It's a horn part.

861
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:20,706
It's very pretty.

862
00:42:22,792 --> 00:42:25,961
You know, just simple
lines intertwining.

863
00:42:26,046 --> 00:42:29,506
You know, very much like... I'm
really influenced by Mozart and Bach,

864
00:42:29,591 --> 00:42:30,883
and it's sort of in
between, though,

865
00:42:30,967 --> 00:42:32,801
it's like a Mach piece, really.

866
00:42:32,886 --> 00:42:34,803
What do you call this?

867
00:42:34,888 --> 00:42:37,848
Well, this piece is
called Lick My Love Pump.

<i>Midwest Airlines, Flight 406...</i>

869
00:42:44,314 --> 00:42:46,398
Excuse me, sir. Do you have any
metal objects in your pockets?

870
00:42:46,483 --> 00:42:49,608
- Yeah.
- Take them out and put them in the bucket.

871
00:42:50,111 --> 00:42:51,820
Coins, keys.

872
00:42:55,825 --> 00:42:57,243
Tuning fork.

873
00:42:57,744 --> 00:43:00,955
Musician. I like to stay in
tune, you know? There you go.

874
00:43:02,165 --> 00:43:03,499
Be a moment.

875
00:43:04,751 --> 00:43:08,254
Okay. Could you take
this jacket off, please?

876
00:43:08,338 --> 00:43:11,298
Oh, it's the zipper
setting off the machine.

877
00:43:11,383 --> 00:43:13,926
Let's go, then.
Let's go, hurry up.

878
00:43:17,264 --> 00:43:19,223
Step over here, please.

879
00:43:19,307 --> 00:43:20,266
Troublemaker.

880
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:21,934
Raise your arms.

<i>- Hey, Artie.
- Polymer Records. How are you?</i>

900
00:45:31,231 --> 00:45:33,023
Hey, how you doing?
You are...

901
00:45:33,108 --> 00:45:34,149
- Derek.
- Derek.

902
00:45:34,234 --> 00:45:35,651
Artie Fufkin, Polymer Records.

903
00:45:35,777 --> 00:45:37,111
- Hello, Artie.
- How are you? I'm your promo man

904
00:45:37,153 --> 00:45:38,695
- here in Chicago. Nice to meet you.
- Well, that's great.

905
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:40,260
I love you guys.
And of course, Nigel.

906
00:45:40,323 --> 00:45:41,448
Nigel.

907
00:45:41,491 --> 00:45:43,534
- I love you. Nigel Tufnel.
- Right.

908
00:45:43,618 --> 00:45:45,452
I love your stuff. I
go back with you guys.

909
00:45:45,537 --> 00:45:47,746
Boy, do I... Artie
Fufkin, Polymer Records.

910
00:45:47,831 --> 00:45:49,039
I love you. And who are you, darling?

911
00:45:49,124 --> 00:45:51,875
- Oh, this is my special new friend, Cindy.
- Hello, Cindy.

912
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,627
- And this is Belinda.
- Hello, Belinda.

913
00:45:53,711 --> 00:45:54,795
Hi, nice to meet you.

914
00:45:54,879 --> 00:45:56,088
Artie Fufkin, Polymer Records, promo.

915
00:45:56,172 --> 00:45:58,549
And I... Oh, what's
going on here? Hi.

916
00:45:58,633 --> 00:46:01,009

- Hi, guys. Artie Fufkin, Polymer Records.

917
00:46:01,094 --> 00:46:02,052
Nice to see you.

918
00:46:02,137 --> 00:46:03,512
And where is David?

919
00:46:03,596 --> 00:46:04,888
Oh, David, hi.

920
00:46:04,973 --> 00:46:06,682
Artie Fufkin. How are you?

921
00:46:06,766 --> 00:46:07,766
It's nice to see you.

922
00:46:07,851 --> 00:46:09,268
We've got something
exciting happening tomorrow.

923
00:46:09,352 --> 00:46:11,687
All right, the food.
The food.

924
00:46:11,771 --> 00:46:16,024
Oh, thank God. Civilization!
Where do I put this?

925
00:46:42,635 --> 00:46:43,886
What are you doing to me here?

926
00:46:44,012 --> 00:46:45,929
- I'm not doing anything.
- I thought we had a relationship here.

927
00:46:46,014 --> 00:46:47,181
I don't know what happened.

928
00:46:47,265 --> 00:46:48,474
Business is terrible, Artie.

929
00:46:48,558 --> 00:46:49,892
What can I tell you?
This is the truth.

930
00:46:49,976 --> 00:46:51,057
I know business is terrible,

931
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:52,540
but what happens
with the record store

932
00:46:52,604 --> 00:46:54,044
with a promotion
and nobody shows up?

933
00:46:54,063 --> 00:46:55,424
This isn't a personal
thing, Artie.

934
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,940
- Nobody's coming to the store...
- Forget personal thing.

935
00:46:57,025 --> 00:47:00,527
We had a relationship here. Forget about
personal, what about our relationship?

936
00:47:02,405 --> 00:47:05,699
I feel like a schlub, and I
don't know what's happening.

937
00:47:05,783 --> 00:47:07,493
It's me. That's
what's happening.

938
00:47:07,577 --> 00:47:10,120
It's me. I did it.
It's my fault.

939
00:47:10,205 --> 00:47:11,205
I know.

940
00:47:11,289 --> 00:47:12,581
We were told "massive radio support".

941
00:47:12,624 --> 00:47:14,666
We did. We did massive, we did
massive. Sponsoring, vast...

942
00:47:14,751 --> 00:47:15,951
We saturated.
We oversaturated.

943
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,336
They said vast radio support.

944
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:19,838
That's what it is. It's
me. I did it. I fucked up.

945
00:47:19,923 --> 00:47:21,924
I fucked up the timing, that's
all. I fucked up the timing.

946
00:47:22,008 --> 00:47:24,176
I got no timing, I got no
timing. I got no timing.

947
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,345
You know what I want you to do?
Will you do something for me?

948
00:47:26,429 --> 00:47:28,180
- What?
- Do me a favour.

949
00:47:28,264 --> 00:47:30,265
Just kick my ass, okay?

950
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:32,100
Kick this ass for
a man, that's all.

951
00:47:32,185 --> 00:47:33,310
- Kick my ass!
- No.

952
00:47:33,394 --> 00:47:35,395
Enjoy! Come on.
I'm not asking,

953
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,147
I'm telling with this.
Kick my ass.

954
00:47:50,119 --> 00:47:53,121
Well, we've kept them waiting
long enough. Let's do it to them.

955
00:47:53,206 --> 00:47:54,206
Come on, Mick!

956
00:47:55,667 --> 00:47:57,209
Let's go, Mr. Shrimpton.

957
00:47:57,293 --> 00:48:00,629
Rock 'n' roll!

958
00:48:03,424 --> 00:48:05,467
Let's hear some
rock 'n' roll!

959
00:48:05,552 --> 00:48:07,803
Rock 'n' roll!
Let's go, then.

960
00:48:09,472 --> 00:48:10,847
Yeah, mate.

961
00:48:12,308 --> 00:48:13,669
It's gonna be a hot one, isn't it?

962
00:48:13,685 --> 00:48:14,766
It's gonna be a great show.

963
00:48:14,811 --> 00:48:16,770
No, it's not an exit.
It's not an exit.

964
00:48:16,854 --> 00:48:18,355
- Don't want an exit.
- No, that's true.

965
00:48:18,439 --> 00:48:20,274
- Oh, this way.
- Hope so.

966
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,651
- Yeah, this way, let's go.
- Probably this way.

967
00:48:27,907 --> 00:48:29,533
- Wait.
- This looks familiar, though.

968
00:48:29,617 --> 00:48:31,410
- Listen.
- Really does.

969
00:48:35,832 --> 00:48:36,873
Shit.

970
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,083
That way.

971
00:48:39,335 --> 00:48:41,336
Let's not lose it, now.
Let's not lose it.

972
00:48:41,421 --> 00:48:43,797
Where the fuck is Ian?
You know, he should be here.

973
00:48:46,843 --> 00:48:48,677
We gotta get to it some way.

974
00:48:48,761 --> 00:48:50,804
We've been on stage, right?

975
00:48:52,181 --> 00:48:53,974
We're in the group.

976
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:55,851
We're in the group
that's playing tonight.

977
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:58,228
You go right straight
through this door here,

978
00:48:58,354 --> 00:49:00,522
down the hall, turn right,

979
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:04,443
and then there's a little
jog there, about 30 feet.

980
00:49:04,527 --> 00:49:06,403
- Jog to the...
- We don't have time for that.

981
00:49:06,529 --> 00:49:08,697
- Go straight ahead.
- We'll trust you, we'll trust you.

982
00:49:08,781 --> 00:49:12,492
Turn right the next two
corners, and first door, a sign,

983
00:49:12,577 --> 00:49:14,620
"Authorized Personnel Only,"

984
00:49:14,704 --> 00:49:16,622
open that door.
That's the stage.

985
00:49:16,706 --> 00:49:18,332
- You think so?
- You're authorized.

986
00:49:18,458 --> 00:49:19,833
- You're musicians, aren't you?
- We've got the guitars.

987
00:49:19,959 --> 00:49:21,835
- Exactly.
- Thank you, thank you very much.

988
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:23,420
Rock 'n' roll!

989
00:49:24,047 --> 00:49:25,631
- Rock 'n' roll!
- Yeah!

990
00:49:25,715 --> 00:49:28,300
Let's get it, let's get it!

991
00:49:28,384 --> 00:49:30,302
No, he said this way.

992
00:49:30,386 --> 00:49:32,429
- Straight here.
- Rock 'n' roll! Here we go! Rock 'n' roll!

993
00:49:32,513 --> 00:49:36,016
Hello, Cleveland!
Hello, Cleveland!

994
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,684
Let's go in.

995
00:49:37,769 --> 00:49:38,935
Fuck!

996
00:49:39,979 --> 00:49:41,521
You must have
made a wrong turn.

997
00:49:41,648 --> 00:49:43,190
We've got to go another way.

998
00:49:43,274 --> 00:49:46,818
Other way.
Other way. Other way.

999
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,654
<i>I hate to keep harping on this,</i>

1000
00:49:48,738 --> 00:49:51,865
<i>but I think that the notion of a
black album has really cursed us.</i>

1001
00:49:51,949 --> 00:49:54,493
<i>Believe me, we're getting some
very substantial reports of air play.</i>

1002
00:49:54,577 --> 00:49:56,244
<i>I don't think we have
to worry about that.</i>

1003
00:49:56,329 --> 00:49:58,622
You know, it might
have been better

1004
00:49:58,748 --> 00:50:01,041
if the album had
been mixed right.

1005
00:50:01,125 --> 00:50:02,793
Well, there's no use
crying over that.

1006
00:50:02,919 --> 00:50:04,628
Of course, that's true.
I mean...

1007
00:50:04,712 --> 00:50:06,129
Well, it just wasn't...

1008
00:50:06,214 --> 00:50:07,547
It was mixed all wrong,
wasn't it?

1009
00:50:07,632 --> 00:50:08,632
- It was mixed wrong?
- Yeah.

1010
00:50:08,716 --> 00:50:10,217
- Were you there? How do you know...
- You couldn't hear...

1011
00:50:10,343 --> 00:50:12,302
- She's heard the record.
- No, but I've heard the album.

1012
00:50:12,387 --> 00:50:14,846
So your judgement is
it was mixed wrong.

1013
00:50:14,931 --> 00:50:16,682
You couldn't hear
the lyrics on all of it.

1014
00:50:16,766 --> 00:50:18,225
You don't agree that
you can't hear the vocals?

1015
00:50:18,309 --> 00:50:20,143
No, I do not agree. No.

1016
00:50:20,228 --> 00:50:23,188
Well, I think maybe it's interesting
that she's bringing it up.

1017
00:50:23,272 --> 00:50:24,898
Well, she'd like
to hear vocals.

1018
00:50:24,982 --> 00:50:26,441
It's like me saying, you know,

1019
00:50:26,526 --> 00:50:29,194
"You're using the wrong
conditioner for your hair."

1020
00:50:29,278 --> 00:50:30,570
Don't be stupid now.

1021
00:50:30,655 --> 00:50:31,780
It looks sort of frizzy.

1022
00:50:31,864 --> 00:50:34,282
You don't do heavy metal
in Doubly, you know. You mix it.

1023
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:36,118
In what? In what?

1024
00:50:36,911 --> 00:50:38,453
- What?
- Dolby.

1025
00:50:38,913 --> 00:50:40,122
In Doubly.
I mean, you can't...

1026
00:50:40,164 --> 00:50:42,325
- In Dublin? What's that?
- She means Dolby, all right?

1027
00:50:42,375 --> 00:50:44,626
She means Dolby. You know
perfectly well what she means.

1028
00:50:45,336 --> 00:50:46,712
We shan't recover from this one.

1029
00:50:46,796 --> 00:50:48,088
We shan't recover from this one.

1030
00:50:48,172 --> 00:50:49,297
Come on.

1031
00:50:49,382 --> 00:50:50,507
Can I have the floor
for just one moment?

1032
00:50:50,591 --> 00:50:53,635
Because I've got something
I'd like to show you.

1033
00:50:54,137 --> 00:50:56,888
Jeanine's been working
on these very hard.

1034
00:50:56,973 --> 00:50:58,640
These are a new direction...

1035
00:50:58,725 --> 00:51:00,350
Got a new idea
for a new presentation.

1036
00:51:00,435 --> 00:51:02,018
...for the stage
look of the band.

1037
00:51:02,103 --> 00:51:03,603
The signs of the zodiac for everyone.

1038
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:06,064
- It's the signs of the zodiac.
- I thought we needed a new presentation.

1039
00:51:06,149 --> 00:51:07,816
This is a look for Viv.
He's a Libra.

1040
00:51:07,984 --> 00:51:09,693
There's the yin-yang...

1041
00:51:09,777 --> 00:51:11,903
- Yin and the yang.
- ...sort of look.

1042
00:51:11,988 --> 00:51:15,115
This is Nigel.
He's a Capricorn.

1043
00:51:15,658 --> 00:51:17,409
- Sort of a goat look.
- We've given you a little beard.

1044
00:51:17,493 --> 00:51:18,702
Is this a joke?

1045
00:51:18,786 --> 00:51:19,911
This is...

1046
00:51:19,996 --> 00:51:21,747
Excuse me, is this a joke?

1047
00:51:21,873 --> 00:51:23,665
Just bear with us
for one moment, please.

1048
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:26,418
This, I love this.
I wish I were the Cancer.

1049
00:51:26,586 --> 00:51:27,711
That's attractive.

1050
00:51:27,795 --> 00:51:28,837
This is your crab face.

1051
00:51:28,921 --> 00:51:30,213
Your brainchild, now.

1052
00:51:30,298 --> 00:51:31,506
Give it a chance,
give it a chance.

1053
00:51:31,591 --> 00:51:33,550
- And this is David...
- David's the lion.

1054
00:51:33,634 --> 00:51:38,221
Please wait a minute. Have
you any idea what it will cost

1055
00:51:39,515 --> 00:51:41,475
to dress up
the band as animals?

1056
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:42,726
Well, they're not animals.

1057
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:43,931
They're signs of the zodiac.

1058
00:51:43,978 --> 00:51:45,771
It's a way to fight the drabs.

1059
00:51:45,855 --> 00:51:47,606
You know, we've got the drabs.

1060
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:50,734
That's true. I think mine
will look better in Doubly,

1061
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:52,527
if it was done in Doubly.

1062
00:51:54,781 --> 00:51:55,989
I'm quite open-minded enough.

1063
00:51:56,073 --> 00:51:57,282
David. No, no, David.

1064
00:51:57,366 --> 00:52:00,118
You know, there are
solutions to our problems.

1065
00:52:00,203 --> 00:52:01,203
I think we know what they are.

1066
00:52:01,287 --> 00:52:03,371
I've yet to hear them.
I've yet to hear them.

1067
00:52:03,456 --> 00:52:04,956
Since you're all
such geniuses...

1068
00:52:05,041 --> 00:52:07,209
We take a rational approach,
we can say...

1069
00:52:07,293 --> 00:52:09,211
May I make a suggestion?
I've got one other suggestion.

1070
00:52:09,295 --> 00:52:10,754
Let's hear yours.
Let's hear your suggestion.

1071
00:52:10,838 --> 00:52:12,964
Stonehenge. Stonehenge.

1072
00:52:13,883 --> 00:52:16,092
- What about it?
- Best production value we've ever had on stage.

1073
00:52:16,177 --> 00:52:17,457
But we haven't
got the equipment.

1074
00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:19,054
- We haven't got Stonehenge.
- Not yet we don't.

1075
00:52:19,138 --> 00:52:21,473
Let's... Please,
please, just a moment.

1076
00:52:21,557 --> 00:52:23,642
- We know it works.
- Musically, we all know it.

1077
00:52:23,726 --> 00:52:25,852
- I don't think it's a bad idea.
- Musically, we all know it, right?

1078
00:52:25,937 --> 00:52:28,688
No problems musically.
We go right on stage,

1079
00:52:28,773 --> 00:52:30,482
and it's quite simple.

1080
00:52:30,566 --> 00:52:32,776
Ian can take care of this.

1081
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:34,736
I know what the
Stonehenge monument looks like.

1082
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:36,571
We don't have that piece
of scenery anymore.

1083
00:52:36,656 --> 00:52:38,907
I know, so we build a new one.

1084
00:52:40,243 --> 00:52:41,743
And this it.

1085
00:52:41,911 --> 00:52:43,411
Consider it done.

1086
00:52:44,372 --> 00:52:45,872
So, you're just gonna
take care of it like that?

1087
00:52:45,957 --> 00:52:48,166
You're gonna find someone to
design it, using that as a plan?

1088
00:52:48,251 --> 00:52:49,251
Let's try. Let's try.

1089
00:52:49,335 --> 00:52:50,775
If you can do it,
I'll do the number.

1090
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:54,172
Do you feel that,
in collaboration with David,

1091
00:52:54,257 --> 00:52:58,718
that you are afforded the opportunity
to express yourself musically

1092
00:52:58,803 --> 00:52:59,970
the way you would like to?

1093
00:53:00,054 --> 00:53:02,305
Well, I think I do,
in my solos.

1094
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:03,974
My solos are my trademark.

1095
00:53:49,979 --> 00:53:52,314
This looks absolutely
perfect. I mean, it's...

1096
00:53:52,398 --> 00:53:54,438
It's the right proportions.
It'll be this colour, eh?

1097
00:53:54,859 --> 00:53:57,110
- Yeah.
- That's just terrific.

1098
00:53:57,236 --> 00:54:00,071
- I mean, it almost looks like the real thing.
- You got it.

1099
00:54:00,156 --> 00:54:03,116
Yeah. When we get the actual
set, when we get the piece,

1100
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,993
it'll follow exactly
these specifications,

1101
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:06,912
even these contours
and everything?

1102
00:54:06,996 --> 00:54:10,749
I don't understand, Ian.
The actual piece?

1103
00:54:10,833 --> 00:54:13,043
When you build
the actual piece.

1104
00:54:13,169 --> 00:54:15,378
But this is what you
asked for, isn't it?

1105
00:54:15,713 --> 00:54:16,838
What?

1106
00:54:17,423 --> 00:54:18,506
Well, this is the piece.

1107
00:54:18,591 --> 00:54:19,674
This is the piece?

1108
00:54:20,134 --> 00:54:21,009
Yes.

1109
00:54:21,093 --> 00:54:22,844
Are you telling
me that this is it?

1110
00:54:23,846 --> 00:54:25,430
This is scenery?

1111
00:54:25,765 --> 00:54:27,390
Have you ever
been to Stonehenge?

1112
00:54:27,475 --> 00:54:28,796
No, I've never
been to Stonehenge.

1113
00:54:28,809 --> 00:54:30,685
The triptychs
are 20-feet high!

1114
00:54:30,811 --> 00:54:32,604
- You can stand four men up them.
- Ian!

1115
00:54:32,688 --> 00:54:34,648
- I was asked to build it...
- This is insane!

1116
00:54:34,774 --> 00:54:36,816
- This isn't a piece of scenery.
- ...18 inches high. Look, look.

1117
00:54:36,901 --> 00:54:38,818
Look, this is what I
was asked to build.

1118
00:54:38,903 --> 00:54:42,197
Eighteen inches. Right
here, it specified 18 inches.

1119
00:54:42,865 --> 00:54:44,186
I was given this napkin.
I mean...

1120
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,200
Forget this!

1121
00:54:45,284 --> 00:54:46,284
Fuck the napkin!

1122
00:54:51,165 --> 00:54:53,625
In ancient times,

1123
00:54:55,336 --> 00:54:59,297
hundreds of years
before the dawn of history

1124
00:55:01,008 --> 00:55:03,718
lived an ancient
race of people:

1125
00:55:06,722 --> 00:55:08,223
The Druids.

1126
00:55:17,817 --> 00:55:20,902
No one knows who they were,

1127
00:55:22,446 --> 00:55:26,116
or what they were doing,

1128
00:55:28,327 --> 00:55:30,912
but their legacy remains,

1129
00:55:32,039 --> 00:55:38,962
hewn into the living rock
of Stonehenge.

1130
00:55:51,392 --> 00:55:54,853
♪ Stonehenge
Where the demons dwell ♪

1131
00:55:54,937 --> 00:55:58,523

1140
00:57:01,337 --> 00:57:04,714
Beneath the haunted moon,

1141
00:57:05,424 --> 00:57:12,013
for fear that daybreak
might come too soon.

1142
00:57:34,036 --> 00:57:36,955
I do not, for one, think that
the problem was that the band was down.

1143
00:57:37,039 --> 00:57:38,623
I think that
the problem may have been

1144
00:57:38,707 --> 00:57:40,250
that there was
a Stonehenge monument

1145
00:57:40,334 --> 00:57:44,129
on the stage that was in danger
of being crushed by a dwarf.

1146
00:57:44,588 --> 00:57:48,550
All right? That tended to understate
the hugeness of the object.

1147
00:57:48,634 --> 00:57:51,052
I really think you're just making
much too big a thing out of it.

1148
00:57:51,137 --> 00:57:53,638
Making a big thing out of it
would have been a good idea.

1149
00:57:53,722 --> 00:57:56,558
Nigel gave me a drawing that
said 18 inches, all right?

1150
00:57:56,642 --> 00:57:58,017
I know he did, and that's
what I'm talking about.

1151
00:57:58,102 --> 00:58:00,645
Whether he knows the difference between
feet and inches is not my problem.

1152
00:58:00,729 --> 00:58:01,771
I do what I'm told.

1153
00:58:01,856 --> 00:58:03,982
But you're not as
confused as him, are you?

1154
00:58:04,066 --> 00:58:06,651
I mean, it's not your job to
be as confused as Nigel is.

1155
00:58:06,735 --> 00:58:10,029
It's my job to do what I'm asked to do
by the creative element of this band.

1156
00:58:10,114 --> 00:58:11,281
And that's what I did.

1157
00:58:11,365 --> 00:58:12,866
The audience were laughing.

1158
00:58:12,992 --> 00:58:15,034
- So it became a comedy number.
- Yes, it did.

1159
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:17,162
Yes, it fucking well did,
and it was not pleasant

1160
00:58:17,246 --> 00:58:18,997
to be part of
the comedy on stage.

1161
00:58:19,081 --> 00:58:21,374
Backstage, perhaps
it was very amusing.

1162
00:58:21,458 --> 00:58:25,086
Maybe we just fix the
choreography, keep the dwarf clear.

1163
00:58:25,629 --> 00:58:28,173
- What do you mean?
- So he won't trod upon it.

1164
00:58:28,257 --> 00:58:29,716
I don't think that's the issue.

1165
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:35,054
I think it's symptomatic that maybe
you're taking on more than you can handle.

1166
00:58:35,806 --> 00:58:38,808
It's not exactly the first time
you've messed things up, is it?

1167
00:58:38,893 --> 00:58:41,352
I mean, there have
been some gaping holes

1168
00:58:41,437 --> 00:58:43,721
- in the business end of this...
- Excuse me for a minute, David.

1169
00:58:43,772 --> 00:58:46,608
Excuse me, this is
a band meeting, right?

1170
00:58:46,734 --> 00:58:48,568
- Are you here for some reason?
- Don't worry about it.

1171
00:58:48,652 --> 00:58:49,819
- She's with me.
- Yeah.

1172
00:58:49,904 --> 00:58:51,946
Is she now in the band?
Is she singing backup?

1173
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:54,407
I care what
happens to the band.

1174
00:58:54,491 --> 00:58:57,869
David, whenever a single bump or a
ruffle comes into this little fantasy,

1175
00:58:57,953 --> 00:59:01,164
adolescent fantasy world you
guys have built around yourself,

1176
00:59:01,248 --> 00:59:04,709
you start screaming like a
bunch of poncey hairdressers.

1177
00:59:04,793 --> 00:59:08,213
I mean, it's just a problem,
you know? It gets solved.

1178
00:59:08,297 --> 00:59:10,381
- It doesn't.
- You can't live in a bubble.

1179
00:59:10,466 --> 00:59:12,383
If it got solved,
that would be all right.

1180
00:59:12,468 --> 00:59:13,760
But it doesn't get solved.

1181
00:59:13,844 --> 00:59:16,284
What do you think happened out
there? What got solved tonight?

1182
00:59:16,305 --> 00:59:19,724
The one thing that goes wrong,
one single thing goes wrong,

1183
00:59:19,808 --> 00:59:21,184
100 things go right.

1184
00:59:21,268 --> 00:59:23,228
- Do you know what I spend my time doing?
- What?

1185
00:59:23,312 --> 00:59:25,313
I sleep two or
three hours a night.

1186
00:59:25,439 --> 00:59:27,398
There's no sex and
drugs for Ian, David.

1187
00:59:27,483 --> 00:59:29,776
You know what I do?
I find lost luggage.

1188
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:32,737
I locate mandolin strings
in the middle of Austin!

1189
00:59:32,821 --> 00:59:35,740
I pries the rent out of the
local Hebrews. That's what I do.

1190
00:59:35,824 --> 00:59:37,992
Maybe you should get
someone else to find the lost luggage,

1191
00:59:38,077 --> 00:59:40,197
and you should concentrate
on what's going on on-stage.

1192
00:59:40,246 --> 00:59:41,621
Yes! That's
what we're talking about.

1193
00:59:41,664 --> 00:59:43,164
- You'd like me to be the road manager?
- All bad... No!

1194
00:59:43,249 --> 00:59:45,208
All bad... Could we...

1195
00:59:45,292 --> 00:59:49,337
What David's trying to say, if
you'll let him get a word through, is

1196
00:59:50,339 --> 00:59:52,966
you could maybe
do with some help.

1197
00:59:53,884 --> 00:59:56,219
- Some help?
- It's very simple, it's very simple.

1198
00:59:56,303 --> 00:59:57,262
It's that clear.

1199
00:59:57,346 --> 00:59:59,722
Maybe there's someone
already in the organization.

1200
00:59:59,807 --> 01:00:01,047
We don't have to pay insurance.

1201
01:00:01,058 --> 01:00:02,809
We don't have to
pay extra room, etcetera.

1202
01:00:02,893 --> 01:00:05,103
Since she's already here,
she's already among us,

1203
01:00:05,187 --> 01:00:06,521
- and she can...
- She?

1204
01:00:06,647 --> 01:00:08,773
- She's perfectly capable to taking over.
- She?

1205
01:00:08,899 --> 01:00:10,692
- Wait a minute!
- Well, who do you think I'm talking about?

1206
01:00:10,818 --> 01:00:12,777
- Who do you think I'm talking about?
- I would never have dreamed

1207
01:00:12,861 --> 01:00:14,612
in a million years, that it
was her you were talking about.

1208
01:00:14,697 --> 01:00:15,780
Why not?

1209
01:00:15,864 --> 01:00:17,824
I am offering to help out.

1210
01:00:17,908 --> 01:00:19,033
No, you're not
offering to help out.

1211
01:00:19,118 --> 01:00:20,994
You're offering to co-manage
the band with me, is that it?

1212
01:00:21,078 --> 01:00:22,199
- Yes.
- Let's get it straight...

1213
01:00:22,204 --> 01:00:23,288
In so many words,
that is exactly it.

1214
01:00:23,372 --> 01:00:24,372
Exactly.

1215
01:00:24,456 --> 01:00:26,457
Well, I'm certainly not going
to co-manage with some girl

1216
01:00:26,542 --> 01:00:27,625
just because
she's your girlfriend.

1217
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:28,960
- His girlfriend, is it?
- Don't call her my girlfriend.

1218
01:00:29,044 --> 01:00:31,963
- All right, she's not your girlfriend. I don't know.
- You couldn't manage a classroom full of kids.

1219
01:00:32,047 --> 01:00:33,214
I don't know what you're
doing managing the band.

1220
01:00:33,299 --> 01:00:34,757
Why don't we just...
Shut up!

1221
01:00:34,842 --> 01:00:37,510
Look, look. I...
This is my position, okay?

1222
01:00:37,594 --> 01:00:39,053
I am not
managing it with you...

1223
01:00:39,179 --> 01:00:41,340
- Good.
- ...or any other woman, especially one who dresses

1224
01:00:41,348 --> 01:00:43,641
like an Australian's
nightmare. So, fuck you.

1225
01:00:43,726 --> 01:00:44,809
- Well, fuck you, too.
- And fuck all of you,

1226
01:00:44,893 --> 01:00:46,644
because I quit.
All right?

1227
01:00:46,729 --> 01:00:48,229
That's it.
Good night.

1228
01:00:58,032 --> 01:01:00,408
Can I raise a practical
question at this point?

1229
01:01:00,492 --> 01:01:01,909
Yeah.

1230
01:01:02,036 --> 01:01:03,453
Are we gonna do
Stonehenge tomorrow?

1231
01:01:03,912 --> 01:01:06,706
No, we're not gonna
fucking do Stonehenge!

1232
01:01:07,624 --> 01:01:09,917
Okay, we're all set.
Thank you.

1233
01:01:10,502 --> 01:01:12,295
All right, fellas,
I've got the tickets.

1234
01:01:12,379 --> 01:01:15,715
We're on the 3:10 flight
at Gate 24.

1235
01:01:15,799 --> 01:01:18,676
All right? And this
arrives at 4:00 in Colorado.

1236
01:01:18,761 --> 01:01:21,346
Then we got a limo
to take us to the lodge.

1237
01:01:21,430 --> 01:01:24,349
It's about 100 yards
from Rainbow Trout Studio.

1238
01:01:24,433 --> 01:01:28,686
What I've done is to arrange
a whole load of charts.

1239
01:01:28,771 --> 01:01:30,372
Wait til you see this.
This is so great.

1240
01:01:30,439 --> 01:01:33,775
Now, I know that
the band's sign is Virgo

1241
01:01:33,859 --> 01:01:36,861
and, you see it,
Saturn's in the third house,

1242
01:01:36,945 --> 01:01:38,988
all right,
and it's a bit rocky.

1243
01:01:39,073 --> 01:01:44,994
But because Virgo is one of the most
highly intelligent signs of the zodiac,

1244
01:01:45,079 --> 01:01:47,538
we're gonna pull through
this with great aplomb.

1245
01:01:47,623 --> 01:01:49,248
- Yeah.
- And has someone not got one?

1246
01:01:49,291 --> 01:01:51,042
- It's so clear. Really is.
- Nigel hasn't got one. Here you go.

1247
01:01:51,126 --> 01:01:52,377
- It's so clear.
- Nigel.

1248
01:01:52,461 --> 01:01:55,755
- Nigel! I've got pages for you.
- I think Nigel has one.

1249
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:57,465
He's got one.
He's got it.

1250
01:01:57,549 --> 01:01:58,549
If you have a look at this...

1251
01:01:58,634 --> 01:02:01,177
If you think about the jumble
the tour book usually is...

1252
01:02:01,261 --> 01:02:03,471
- No, he's got one. He's got one.
- He's got one? All right.

1253
01:02:03,555 --> 01:02:04,715
And what's all this on the...

1254
01:02:04,765 --> 01:02:07,046
Now, what I want to explain
to you here, is that Denver...

1255
01:02:07,226 --> 01:02:11,729
How would you characterize your
relationship with David over the years?

1256
01:02:11,814 --> 01:02:13,856
Has it changed in any way?

1257
01:02:13,982 --> 01:02:16,025
Not really. I mean, you know, they go...

1258
01:02:16,110 --> 01:02:17,819
We've grown up.

1259
01:02:18,695 --> 01:02:21,656
But, really, it's not...
No, not really.

1260
01:02:22,366 --> 01:02:26,327
We feel like children much of
the time, even when we're playing.

1261
01:02:26,912 --> 01:02:28,996
We're closer than brothers.

1262
01:02:30,374 --> 01:02:32,250
Brothers always fight.

1263
01:02:32,376 --> 01:02:34,293
Sort of disagreements
and all that.

1264
01:02:35,671 --> 01:02:39,841
We really have a relationship
that's way, way past that.

1265
01:02:45,848 --> 01:02:47,056
He can't play
the fucking guitar anymore.

1266
01:02:47,141 --> 01:02:48,182
You know the parts.

1267
01:02:48,267 --> 01:02:49,559
- You did it this morning.
- No, he doesn't know the...

1268
01:02:49,643 --> 01:02:52,103
If he knew the fucking part,
he'd play it, wouldn't he?

1269
01:02:52,187 --> 01:02:53,563
- That's it.
- Are you walking out?

1270
01:02:53,647 --> 01:02:55,064
Fuck. I'm not planning on walking out.

1271
01:02:55,149 --> 01:02:57,525
Great. Just tell me what I'm
supposed to do, all right?

1272
01:02:57,609 --> 01:02:59,890
Well, we're supposed to play
the fucking thing, aren't we?

1273
01:02:59,903 --> 01:03:01,744
We have no choice.
We spent an hour and half...

1274
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:03,114
- Well, I'm doing my part.
- ...setting up this...

1275
01:03:03,198 --> 01:03:04,615
You know what would
make this a lot simpler?

1276
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:06,909
I mean, I hate to
cut right to it here.

1277
01:03:07,035 --> 01:03:08,578
Why don't you play this alone,

1278
01:03:08,662 --> 01:03:10,496
without some fucking angel
hanging over your head,

1279
01:03:10,581 --> 01:03:11,956
you know what I mean?

1280
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:14,584
Jesus Christ.
This is fucking all we need.

1281
01:03:14,835 --> 01:03:17,628
You can't fucking concentrate
because of your fucking wife.

1282
01:03:17,713 --> 01:03:18,838
Simple as that, all right?

1283
01:03:18,922 --> 01:03:20,006
It's your fucking wife.

1284
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:21,132
She's not my wife.

1285
01:03:21,216 --> 01:03:22,633
Well, whatever the
fuck she is, all right?

1286
01:03:22,718 --> 01:03:24,093
You can't concentrate.

1287
01:03:24,178 --> 01:03:25,928
- We can't fucking do that track.
- This is unbelievable.

1288
01:03:26,054 --> 01:03:28,014
- This is unbelievable.
- No, it's not unbelievable at all.

1289
01:03:28,098 --> 01:03:29,474
- Will you check me on this?
- It all leads up to this.

1290
01:03:29,558 --> 01:03:31,309
- Am I losing my fucking mind?
- It all leads up to this.

1291
01:03:31,393 --> 01:03:33,194
Can you check me on this?
Am I losing my mind?

1292
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:36,189
I don't understand what
this has to do with anything.

1293
01:03:36,482 --> 01:03:38,399
We're very lucky
in the sense that

1294
01:03:38,484 --> 01:03:40,985
we've got two visionaries
in the band.

1295
01:03:41,487 --> 01:03:44,489
- You know, David and Nigel are both...
- Right.

1296
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:46,324
...like poets, you know.

1297
01:03:46,408 --> 01:03:48,534
Like Shelley or Byron
or people like that.

1298
01:03:48,619 --> 01:03:51,662
They're two totally distinct
types of visionaries.

1299
01:03:51,747 --> 01:03:54,165
It's like fire and ice,
basically, you see,

1300
01:03:54,249 --> 01:03:56,167
and I feel my role
is to, in the band,

1301
01:03:56,251 --> 01:03:57,771
is to be kind of
in the middle of that.

1302
01:03:57,836 --> 01:03:59,754
Kind of like lukewarm water, in a sense.

1303
01:04:08,013 --> 01:04:10,214
Listen, I don't think we've
got time to go to the hotel.

1304
01:04:10,265 --> 01:04:11,849
I think you better go
straight to the base.

1305
01:04:11,934 --> 01:04:12,975
To the what?

1306
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:14,393
- Base?
- The gig.

1307
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:16,187
- Yeah, to the base.
- To the Civic Arena, right?

1308
01:04:16,271 --> 01:04:17,271
- Yeah.
- No!

1309
01:04:17,356 --> 01:04:18,481
No, that fell through.

1310
01:04:18,565 --> 01:04:19,732
- We had it.
- What do you mean?

1311
01:04:19,816 --> 01:04:21,150
Wait a second.
Hold it, hold it.

1312
01:04:21,235 --> 01:04:23,611
What do you... Do you know about
this and we don't know about this?

1313
01:04:23,695 --> 01:04:24,820
What are you talking about?

1314
01:04:24,905 --> 01:04:26,226
We're going
to the Air Force base.

1315
01:04:26,281 --> 01:04:27,949
Why are we going
to an Air Force base?

1316
01:04:28,033 --> 01:04:30,451
'Cause the original gig
fell through.

1317
01:04:35,749 --> 01:04:37,708
- Lieutenant Hookstratten?
- Hookstratten.

1318
01:04:37,793 --> 01:04:39,043
You are Spinal Tarp?

1319
01:04:39,126 --> 01:04:41,988
I'm Jeanine Pettibone
and this is Spinal Tap.

1320
01:04:42,019 --> 01:04:43,214
Spinal Tap, my mistake.

1321
01:04:43,298 --> 01:04:44,799
I'm Lieutenant
Bob Hookstratten.

1322
01:04:44,883 --> 01:04:46,884
Welcome to Lindberg
Air Force Base.

1323
01:04:46,969 --> 01:04:49,428
Is this your gentlemen's first
visit to a military facility?

1324
01:04:49,513 --> 01:04:51,305
- Yeah.
- Fine, may I start by saying

1325
01:04:51,390 --> 01:04:53,057
how thrilled we are
to have you here?

1326
01:04:53,141 --> 01:04:54,809
We are such fans of your music

1327
01:04:54,935 --> 01:04:56,602
- and all of your records.
- That's great.

1328
01:04:56,687 --> 01:04:58,271
I'm not speaking
of yours personally,

1329
01:04:58,355 --> 01:04:59,956
but the whole genre
of the rock 'n' roll.

1330
01:04:59,982 --> 01:05:01,063
- I understand that.
- Yeah.

1331
01:05:01,108 --> 01:05:03,359
And so many of the exciting things
that are happening in music today.

1332
01:05:03,443 --> 01:05:04,527
And let me explain a bit
about what's going on.

1333
01:05:04,611 --> 01:05:07,488
This is our monthly
"at-ease weekend".

1334
01:05:07,739 --> 01:05:09,532
It gives us a chance
to kind of let down our hair.

1335
01:05:09,658 --> 01:05:12,243
Although, I see you
all have a head start on that.

1336
01:05:12,327 --> 01:05:14,787
These haircuts wouldn't pass
military muster, believe me.

1337
01:05:14,871 --> 01:05:16,163
Although, I shouldn't talk.

1338
01:05:16,248 --> 01:05:17,498
My hair's getting
a little shaggy, too.

1339
01:05:17,583 --> 01:05:19,917
Better not get too close to you.
They'll think I'm part of the band.

1340
01:05:20,002 --> 01:05:21,210
I'm joking, of course.

1341
01:05:21,295 --> 01:05:22,896
Shall we go in,
and I'll show you around?

1342
01:05:23,213 --> 01:05:25,881
Walk this way,
please. Right through here.

1343
01:05:25,966 --> 01:05:28,486
Did you ever run into a musical
group, works out of Kansas City,

1344
01:05:28,510 --> 01:05:30,386
calls himself
Four Jacks and a Jill?

1345
01:05:30,512 --> 01:05:32,388
They've been at a Ramada Inn
there for about 18 months.

1346
01:05:32,472 --> 01:05:35,308
If you're ever in Kansas City and
you want to hear some good music,

1347
01:05:35,392 --> 01:05:37,435
you might want to drop by.

1348
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:43,357
I would like to get the playing on about
19:00 hours if that's satisfactory.

1349
01:05:43,609 --> 01:05:47,445
- When will that be?
- I make it now, it's about 18:30 hours.

1350
01:05:47,529 --> 01:05:48,821
So, that's what?
50 hours?

1351
01:05:48,905 --> 01:05:50,197
120 hours?

1352
01:05:50,490 --> 01:05:52,158
That's actually
about 30 minutes.

1353
01:05:52,242 --> 01:05:54,869
About a half hour, give or take just a few minutes.
I don't want to rush you.

1354
01:05:54,953 --> 01:05:57,955
The idea is if we can get it
on, then we get it over with.

1355
01:05:58,040 --> 01:05:59,121
And I have just one request.

1356
01:05:59,124 --> 01:06:01,334
Would you play a couple of
slow numbers so I can dance?

He totally
ruined the gig, there.

1378
01:07:19,287 --> 01:07:20,830
And he walks off
and then, you know...

1379
01:07:20,956 --> 01:07:23,874
I mean, he can't be expected
to sit at home and get monies.

1380
01:07:23,959 --> 01:07:25,501
We've got to get
someone else in there.

1381
01:07:25,585 --> 01:07:26,961
Has he ever done
this before? Has he ever...

1382
01:07:27,045 --> 01:07:28,379
- Well, no, but...
- ...quit the band before?

1383
01:07:28,463 --> 01:07:30,047
Well, no, but it's...

1384
01:07:30,132 --> 01:07:31,590
You've got to
understand that, like,

1385
01:07:31,675 --> 01:07:33,551
in the world of
rock 'n' roll there are

1386
01:07:33,635 --> 01:07:35,928
certain changes
that sometimes occur,

1387
01:07:36,972 --> 01:07:38,347
and you've just
got to, sort of,

1388
01:07:38,432 --> 01:07:39,724
roll with them, you know.
I mean, this...

1389
01:07:39,808 --> 01:07:41,684
You've read...
You read that... You know,

1390
01:07:41,768 --> 01:07:43,102
you saw exactly how many people

1391
01:07:43,186 --> 01:07:44,520
have been in this
band over the years.

1392
01:07:44,604 --> 01:07:47,398
Thirty-seven people have been
in this band over the years.

1393
01:07:47,482 --> 01:07:49,567
I mean, it's like, you know,
six months from now,

1394
01:07:49,651 --> 01:07:53,487
I can't see myself missing
Nige any more than I might miss

1395
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:55,906
Ross MacLochness
or Ronnie Pudding

1396
01:07:56,032 --> 01:07:59,410
or Denny Upham or Little Danny
Schindler, any of those, you know.

1397
01:07:59,494 --> 01:08:00,661
I can't believe that.

1398
01:08:00,746 --> 01:08:03,038
I can't believe that, you know, you're

1399
01:08:03,623 --> 01:08:05,499
lumping Nigel in with

1400
01:08:06,418 --> 01:08:09,086
these people you played with
for short periods of time.

1401
01:08:09,171 --> 01:08:10,492
Well, I'm sure I'd feel
much worse

1402
01:08:10,505 --> 01:08:12,339
if I weren't under
such heavy sedation,

1403
01:08:12,424 --> 01:08:14,133
but still, in all, I mean,

1404
01:08:14,217 --> 01:08:17,428
you've got to be realistic about
this sort of thing, you know.

1405
01:08:17,512 --> 01:08:19,847
So what happens
to the band now?

1406
01:08:20,515 --> 01:08:21,599
What do you mean?

1407
01:08:21,683 --> 01:08:22,641
Well, this is...
He's not coming back? Or...

1408
01:08:22,726 --> 01:08:25,186
No, we shan't
work together again.

1409
01:08:34,321 --> 01:08:35,946
- Oh, no.
- Great.

1410
01:08:36,031 --> 01:08:39,575
If I told them once, I
told them a hundred times,

1411
01:08:39,826 --> 01:08:43,120
put Spinal Tap first
and puppet show last.

1412
01:08:43,205 --> 01:08:45,539
It's a morale builder,
isn't it?

1413
01:08:45,665 --> 01:08:47,425
You've got a big dressing
room, though. What?

1414
01:08:47,459 --> 01:08:49,251
It's all right. You know,
you've got the big dressing room.

1415
01:08:49,336 --> 01:08:50,920
We got a bigger dressing
room than the puppets?

1416
01:08:51,004 --> 01:08:52,365
- The Muppet Show.
- That's refreshing.

1417
01:08:52,672 --> 01:08:54,882
I've got some of this
Mendocino Rocket Fuel

1418
01:08:54,966 --> 01:08:56,175
that's supposed
to be really nice.

1419
01:08:56,259 --> 01:08:57,468
Can you play...

1420
01:08:57,552 --> 01:09:00,638
Excuse me, Viv.
Can you play a bass line

1421
01:09:00,722 --> 01:09:02,765
like Nigel used
to on Big Bottom?

1422
01:09:02,849 --> 01:09:04,016
- Can you double that?
- Yeah.

1423
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:05,601
You might recall the line,
it's in fifths.

1424
01:09:05,685 --> 01:09:08,145
Oh yeah, I've got two
hands here. I can do it.

1425
01:09:08,230 --> 01:09:09,647
Great. So that's
good. We can play that one.

1426
01:09:09,731 --> 01:09:10,898
- All right, that's it.
- Hole is out.

1427
01:09:10,982 --> 01:09:12,066
Heavy is out.

1428
01:09:12,192 --> 01:09:14,068
- Heavy, Hole, Heavy, Hole...
- Right, right, right. We know.

1429
01:09:14,152 --> 01:09:15,903
- America we know is out.
- America we can't do.

1430
01:09:15,987 --> 01:09:16,987
That's Nigel's tune.
That's not my tune.

1431
01:09:17,072 --> 01:09:17,988
We know, we know.

1432
01:09:18,073 --> 01:09:19,156
That's a nice
little set, isn't it?

1433
01:09:19,241 --> 01:09:21,158
That's a cosy 10 minutes.

1434
01:09:21,243 --> 01:09:22,660
What we gonna do?
We got nothing to play here.

1435
01:09:22,744 --> 01:09:25,079
- We got nothing.
- I'll tell you what we're gonna have to do.

1436
01:09:25,163 --> 01:09:26,288
What?

1437
01:09:26,414 --> 01:09:27,581
Jazz Odyssey.

1438
01:09:27,999 --> 01:09:32,503
We're not going about to do
a free-form jazz exploration

1439
01:09:32,587 --> 01:09:34,296
in front of a festival crowd.

1440
01:09:35,423 --> 01:09:40,928
You are witnesses at the new
birth of Spinal Tap Mark II.

1441
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:46,058
Hope you enjoy
our new direction.

1442
01:10:06,705 --> 01:10:10,499
On the bass, Derek Smalls.
He wrote this.

1443
01:10:19,843 --> 01:10:21,218
So, tonight's
the last show of the tour.

1444
01:10:21,303 --> 01:10:22,386
How's that feel?

1445
01:10:22,470 --> 01:10:24,071
You know, is this,
like, your last waltz?

1446
01:10:24,139 --> 01:10:25,764
Are we talking
the end of Spinal Tap?

1447
01:10:25,849 --> 01:10:27,433
Or are you going to
try to milk it for

1448
01:10:27,517 --> 01:10:29,059
a few more years
in Europe? I mean...

1449
01:10:29,144 --> 01:10:34,064
Well, I don't, I don't really
think that the end can be assessed,

1450
01:10:34,649 --> 01:10:37,484
as of itself, as being the end,

1451
01:10:37,569 --> 01:10:39,153
because what does
the end feel like?

1452
01:10:39,237 --> 01:10:42,948
It's like saying when you try and
extrapolate the end of the universe.

1453
01:10:43,033 --> 01:10:46,285
If you say the end... If the
universe is indeed infinite,

1454
01:10:46,369 --> 01:10:47,661
then how...
What does that mean?

1455
01:10:47,746 --> 01:10:49,747
How far is all the way?

1456
01:10:49,831 --> 01:10:51,457
And then if it stops,
what's stopping it,

1457
01:10:51,541 --> 01:10:53,125
and what's behind
what's stopping it?

1458
01:10:53,168 --> 01:10:55,669
- So, "What's the end," you know...
- Mmm-hmm.

1459
01:10:55,754 --> 01:10:57,087
...is my question
to you.

1460
01:10:57,547 --> 01:10:58,714
It's a good crowd.
Good crowd.

1461
01:10:58,798 --> 01:10:59,924
It is, isn't it?

1462
01:11:00,008 --> 01:11:02,343
Yeah, it really is. I mean, you
know, some of these things just...

1463
01:11:02,427 --> 01:11:04,637
Well, it's hard to get at
the last minute, you know?

1464
01:11:04,721 --> 01:11:07,765
You can't arrange
it all overnight.

1465
01:11:07,849 --> 01:11:10,267
David, we had
a 15-year ride, mate.

1466
01:11:10,352 --> 01:11:13,062
I mean, who wants to be a fucking
45-year-old rock 'n' roller

1467
01:11:13,146 --> 01:11:15,648
farting around in front of
people less than half their age?

1468
01:11:15,732 --> 01:11:16,774
That is so true, yeah.

1469
01:11:16,858 --> 01:11:20,027
Cranking out some kind of
mediocre head-banging bullshit,

1470
01:11:20,111 --> 01:11:22,277
you know, that we forgot...
Yeah, well, it's beneath us.

1471
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:23,238
That's right.

1472
01:11:23,323 --> 01:11:24,803
- Who wants to see it?
- Absolutely right.

1473
01:11:24,866 --> 01:11:26,241
Not me. I mean, you can
take all those projects

1474
01:11:26,326 --> 01:11:27,660
that we thought,
you know, we didn't...

1475
01:11:27,744 --> 01:11:29,119
Oh, there's dozens,
they're so...

1476
01:11:29,204 --> 01:11:31,664
You know, we didn't have
time for them because of Tap,

1477
01:11:31,748 --> 01:11:33,374
and bring them
back to life, maybe.

1478
01:11:33,458 --> 01:11:34,917
Do you remember what we
were... Do you remember...

1479
01:11:35,001 --> 01:11:38,963
At the Luton Palace, we were
talking about a rock musical

1480
01:11:39,047 --> 01:11:40,297
based on the life
of Jack the Ripper.

1481
01:11:40,382 --> 01:11:42,383
- Yeah, Saucy Jack.
- Right, Saucy Jack.

1482
01:11:42,467 --> 01:11:43,467
Saucy Jack.
Now's the time to do that.

1483
01:11:43,551 --> 01:11:45,970
♪ You're a naughty one
Saucy Jack ♪

1484
01:11:46,054 --> 01:11:48,430
♪ You're a haughty one
Saucy Jack ♪

1485
01:11:48,556 --> 01:11:50,265
- Right.
- Bit of freeing up, isn't it?

1486
01:11:50,350 --> 01:11:52,309
It's all this free time is...
Suddenly, time is so elastic.

1487
01:11:52,394 --> 01:11:54,645
It's a gift.
It's a gift of freedom.

1488
01:11:54,729 --> 01:11:58,607
I've always wanted to do a
collection of my acoustic numbers

1489
01:11:58,692 --> 01:12:01,485
with the London Philharmonic,
as you know.

1490
01:12:01,569 --> 01:12:02,695
- We're lucky.
- Yeah.

1491
01:12:02,779 --> 01:12:05,406
I mean, people should be, people
should be envying us, you know.

1492
01:12:05,490 --> 01:12:06,782
- I envy us.
- Yeah.

1493
01:12:06,866 --> 01:12:07,992
- I do.
- Me, too.

1494
01:12:16,084 --> 01:12:18,127
It's gonna be fine, right?

1495
01:12:19,713 --> 01:12:21,005
We'll make them miss us.

1496
01:12:21,089 --> 01:12:22,464
Nice thought.

1497
01:12:24,926 --> 01:12:26,135
I'm in.

1498
01:12:26,469 --> 01:12:27,928
I'm in tune.

1499
01:12:28,263 --> 01:12:29,743
Come on, the last tuning.
let's go in.

1500
01:12:29,848 --> 01:12:31,682
- I think we should go in, huh?
- The last tuning.

1501
01:12:31,808 --> 01:12:33,642
I think it's time to go, right?

1502
01:12:34,477 --> 01:12:35,561
Can we go?

1503
01:12:35,854 --> 01:12:36,770
Yeah.

1504
01:12:37,397 --> 01:12:41,066
All right, we're going to
do a good show, a dynamite show.

1505
01:12:56,791 --> 01:12:58,625
Come to see the show?

1506
01:12:59,461 --> 01:13:00,586
Yeah.

1507
01:13:00,962 --> 01:13:02,629
- Hi, Mick.
- Nige.

1508
01:13:07,343 --> 01:13:09,511
So, did you just come here
to hang around backstage,

1509
01:13:09,596 --> 01:13:10,717
like a real rock 'n' roller?

1510
01:13:10,764 --> 01:13:12,056
Is that what you're doing?

1511
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:14,099
I'm really a messenger.

1512
01:13:14,225 --> 01:13:15,726
- Oh, a messenger?
- Yeah.

1513
01:13:15,810 --> 01:13:17,311
I bumped into Ian, and...

1514
01:13:17,395 --> 01:13:18,687
Ian? Ian?

1515
01:13:19,439 --> 01:13:21,648
Oh, the other dead man, yeah.

1516
01:13:21,775 --> 01:13:26,236
Seems that Sex Farm
is on the charts in Japan.

1517
01:13:27,072 --> 01:13:28,989
Spinal Tap's
recording, Sex Farm?

1518
01:13:29,074 --> 01:13:32,284
It's number five
last week, actually, and...

1519
01:13:32,368 --> 01:13:34,328
So, he...

1520
01:13:34,954 --> 01:13:39,500
He asked me to ask you, Tap,

1521
01:13:40,710 --> 01:13:46,924
if you'd be interested in
reforming and doing a tour, Japan.

1522
01:13:47,675 --> 01:13:51,095
So you've come back to re-plug our
life-support systems in, is that it?

1523
01:13:51,179 --> 01:13:53,430
By the grace of your...

1524
01:13:53,515 --> 01:13:55,265
By the stroke of your hand,
you're going to set us...

1525
01:13:55,350 --> 01:13:57,684
Is that what you're going to do?
You gonna bring us back to life?

1526
01:13:57,727 --> 01:13:59,186
- That what you've come here for?
- No, I've come...

1527
01:13:59,270 --> 01:14:00,351
I mean, it's...
Don't you...

1528
01:14:00,355 --> 01:14:04,358
The fucking nerve that
you display in coming...

1529
01:14:04,442 --> 01:14:06,193
No, that's...

1530
01:14:06,319 --> 01:14:08,362
I'm just passing on
the information, really.

1531
01:14:09,364 --> 01:14:11,281
Yeah, well, I think it's time to go in.

1532
01:14:11,366 --> 01:14:13,200
We haven't got time
to discuss this now.

1533
01:14:13,284 --> 01:14:14,535
Come on.

1534
01:14:18,039 --> 01:14:19,414
All right?

1535
01:14:41,271 --> 01:14:42,563
David...

1536
01:14:43,898 --> 01:14:45,983
Do a good show, all right?

1537
01:14:47,193 --> 01:14:48,569

Do you feel that playing
rock-'n'-roll music keeps you a child?

1565
01:17:38,239 --> 01:17:41,491
That is, keeps you in a state
of arrested development?

1566
01:17:41,576 --> 01:17:43,952
No, no.
No, I feel it's like...

1567
01:17:44,037 --> 01:17:47,622
It's more like going to a
national park or something,

1568
01:17:47,707 --> 01:17:50,167
and there's, you know,
they preserve the moose.

1569
01:17:50,251 --> 01:17:52,252
And that's my
childhood up there

1570
01:17:52,337 --> 01:17:54,338
on stage,
is that moose, you know?

1571
01:17:54,422 --> 01:17:56,673
So, when you're playing, you feel
like a preserved moose on stage?

1572
01:17:56,758 --> 01:17:57,758
Yeah.

1573
01:17:57,842 --> 01:18:01,595
I've been listening to the classics.
I belong to a great series.

1574
01:18:02,430 --> 01:18:04,973
It's called the Namesake
Series, of cassettes.

1575
01:18:05,058 --> 01:18:07,184
And they send you the works
of famous authors

1576
01:18:07,268 --> 01:18:09,978
done by actors with
the same last name.

1577
01:18:10,313 --> 01:18:13,815
So I've got Denholm Elliott
reading T.S. Eliot on this one.

1578
01:18:13,941 --> 01:18:15,484
- Well, that's interesting.
- Yes.

1579
01:18:15,568 --> 01:18:17,527
I've got Danny Thomas
doing A Child's

1580
01:18:17,612 --> 01:18:19,529
Christmas in
Wales by Dylan Thomas.

1581
01:18:19,614 --> 01:18:24,785
And next month, it's McLean Stevenson
reads Robert Louis Stevenson.

1582
01:18:25,411 --> 01:18:26,495
Treasure Island, I believe.

1583
01:18:26,621 --> 01:18:28,455
- That's interesting. That's fascinating.
- Yeah.

1584
01:18:28,539 --> 01:18:29,790
There's also something...

1585
01:18:29,874 --> 01:18:32,209
There's a shorter works
of Washington Irving

1586
01:18:32,293 --> 01:18:34,544
read by someone
called Dr. J.

1587
01:18:34,629 --> 01:18:36,338
Oh, that's Julius Erving.

1588
01:18:36,464 --> 01:18:38,173
- There you go.
- Julius Erving, the basketball player.

1589
01:18:38,257 --> 01:18:39,383
In keeping with
the series, yeah.

1590
01:18:39,467 --> 01:18:40,550
I didn't know that.

1591
01:18:40,635 --> 01:18:41,635
You like this?

1592
01:18:41,719 --> 01:18:42,886
It's very nice.
It looks like Halloween.

1593
01:18:42,970 --> 01:18:47,140
This is my exact inner
structure, done in a T-shirt.

1594
01:18:47,892 --> 01:18:50,268
Exactly medically accurate. See?

1595
01:18:50,812 --> 01:18:52,312
So, in other words,
if we were to

1596
01:18:52,397 --> 01:18:54,022
take all your
flesh and blood...

1597
01:18:54,107 --> 01:18:55,565
Take them off.
And you'd see...

1598
01:18:55,650 --> 01:18:58,360
- This is what you'd see.
- It wouldn't be green, though.

1599
01:18:58,444 --> 01:18:59,820
It is green.

1600
01:18:59,904 --> 01:19:02,406
You know, see how
your blood looks blue?

1601
01:19:02,490 --> 01:19:03,782
Yeah, well,
that's just the vein,

1602
01:19:03,866 --> 01:19:05,242
I mean, the colour
of the vein, I mean.

1603
01:19:05,326 --> 01:19:06,618
The blood is actually red.

1604
01:19:06,702 --> 01:19:08,328
Oh, maybe it's not green, then.

1605
01:19:08,371 --> 01:19:10,455
- Anyway, this is what I sleep in sometimes.
- Yeah.

1606
01:19:10,706 --> 01:19:12,707
Denis Eton-Hogg,
the president

1607
01:19:12,792 --> 01:19:15,710
of Polymer Records,
was recently knighted.

1608
01:19:16,045 --> 01:19:19,256
What were the circumstances
surrounding his knighthood?

1609
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:21,091
The specific reason
why he was knighted

1610
01:19:21,175 --> 01:19:23,510
was for the founding
of Hoggwood,

1611
01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:27,514
which is a summer camp
for pale young boys.

1612
01:19:30,143 --> 01:19:31,560
David St. Hubbins,

1613
01:19:31,644 --> 01:19:34,062
I must admit, I've never heard
of anybody with that name.

1614
01:19:34,147 --> 01:19:35,313
It's an unusual name.

1615
01:19:35,398 --> 01:19:36,773
Well, he was an unusual saint.

1616
01:19:36,858 --> 01:19:38,400
He's not a very
well-known saint.

1617
01:19:38,484 --> 01:19:39,985
Oh, there actually is...
There was a saint Hubbins?

1618
01:19:40,069 --> 01:19:41,445
Oh, yes.
That's right, yes.

1619
01:19:41,529 --> 01:19:43,029
Yeah. What was he the saint of?

1620
01:19:43,114 --> 01:19:46,032
He was the patron saint
of quality footwear.

1621
01:19:46,117 --> 01:19:50,871
You play to predominantly
a white audience.

1622
01:19:51,038 --> 01:19:53,457
Do you feel your music
is racist in any way?

1623
01:19:53,541 --> 01:19:55,792
No, not at all.
No, of course not.

1624
01:19:55,877 --> 01:19:58,295
You know, we say,
"Love your brother."

1625
01:19:58,379 --> 01:19:59,671
We don't say it, really, but...

1626
01:19:59,714 --> 01:20:01,423
- We don't literally say it.
- No, we don't say it.

1627
01:20:01,549 --> 01:20:03,508
- We don't really literally mean it.
- We don't believe it either.

1628
01:20:03,593 --> 01:20:05,719
- But we're not racists.
- But...

1629
01:20:05,803 --> 01:20:07,243
That message
should be clear, anyway.

1630
01:20:07,305 --> 01:20:08,680
We're anything but racists.

1631
01:20:08,764 --> 01:20:11,183
You know, we've grown musically. I mean,
you listen to some of the rubbish

1632
01:20:11,267 --> 01:20:13,477
- we did early on, it was stupid.
- Yeah.

1633
01:20:13,561 --> 01:20:16,104
You know, now, I mean,
a song like Sex Farm,

1634
01:20:16,189 --> 01:20:19,107
we're taking a sophisticated

1635
01:20:19,192 --> 01:20:22,569
view of the idea of sex,
you know, and...

1636
01:20:22,987 --> 01:20:24,738
- Putting it on a farm.
- Yeah.

1637
01:20:24,822 --> 01:20:27,282
If I were to ask you
what your philosophy

1638
01:20:27,366 --> 01:20:29,910
of life or your creed,
what would that be?

1639
01:20:30,953 --> 01:20:36,166
Have a good time all the time.

1640
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:40,128
That's my philosophy, Marty.

1641
01:20:40,254 --> 01:20:42,339
I believe virtually
everything I read,

1642
01:20:42,423 --> 01:20:46,843
and I think that is what makes
me more of a selective human

1643
01:20:46,928 --> 01:20:49,012
than someone who doesn't
believe anything.

1644
01:20:49,096 --> 01:20:52,390
Do you have a philosophy
or creed that you live by?

1645
01:20:52,642 --> 01:20:55,602
Well, you know, personally,
I like to think about

1646
01:20:55,686 --> 01:20:57,604
sex and drugs and
rock 'n' roll, you know.

1647
01:20:57,688 --> 01:20:58,688
- That's my life.
- Yeah.

1648
01:20:58,773 --> 01:21:02,317
If you were to have
something written as your epitaph...

1649
01:21:03,277 --> 01:21:05,946
"Here lies David St. Hubbins,

1650
01:21:08,449 --> 01:21:09,908
"and why not?"

1651
01:21:12,245 --> 01:21:13,995
You feel that sums up your...

1652
01:21:14,121 --> 01:21:16,201
- No, it's the first thing I could think of.
- Oh, I see.

1653
01:21:16,249 --> 01:21:17,610
It doesn't sum up
anything, really.

1654
01:21:17,667 --> 01:21:18,959
Yeah.

1655
01:21:19,043 --> 01:21:21,795
I'm a real fish nut.
I really like fish.

1656
01:21:21,921 --> 01:21:23,630
What kind of fish?

1657
01:21:24,048 --> 01:21:26,341
Well, in the United States,
you have cod.

1658
01:21:26,592 --> 01:21:27,926
I like cod.

1659
01:21:28,010 --> 01:21:30,720
And I love tuna, those
little cans you've got here.

1660
01:21:30,805 --> 01:21:32,472
- Tuna fish.
- Yeah.

1661
01:21:32,848 --> 01:21:34,349
- No bones.
- Yeah.

1662
01:21:36,686 --> 01:21:39,896
If you could not play
rock 'n' roll, what would you do?

1663
01:21:39,981 --> 01:21:42,065
I'd be a full-time dreamer.

1664
01:21:42,149 --> 01:21:44,150
I'd probably get
a bit stupid and start

1665
01:21:44,277 --> 01:21:46,236
to make a fool of
myself in public,

1666
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,655
'cause there wouldn't
be a stage to go on.

1667
01:21:48,739 --> 01:21:50,907
Probably work with children.

1668
01:21:51,534 --> 01:21:54,494
As long as there's, you know,
sex and drugs,

1669
01:21:54,579 --> 01:21:56,204
I can do without
the rock 'n' roll.

1670
01:21:57,665 --> 01:22:00,875
I suppose I could work
in a shop of some kind,

1671
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:06,047
or do freelance selling
of some sort of product.

1672
01:22:07,091 --> 01:22:08,174
A salesman? You think...

1673
01:22:08,259 --> 01:22:10,885
A salesman.
Maybe in a haberdasher.

1674
01:22:10,970 --> 01:22:15,765
Or maybe like a
chapeau shop or something.

1675
01:22:16,601 --> 01:22:20,270
You know, like, "Would you...
What size do you wear, sir?"

1676
01:22:20,354 --> 01:22:21,354
And then you answer me.

1677
01:22:21,439 --> 01:22:22,939
Seven and a quarter.

1678
01:22:23,024 --> 01:22:24,899
"I think we have that."

1679
01:22:25,026 --> 01:22:27,068
- See, something like that, I could do.
- Yeah.

1680
01:22:27,153 --> 01:22:28,486
Do you think you'd be happy
doing something...

1681
01:22:28,571 --> 01:22:31,281
"No, we're all out.
Do you wear black?"

1682
01:22:31,365 --> 01:22:34,200
See, that sort of thing I think
I could probably muster up.

1683
01:22:34,285 --> 01:22:37,245
Yeah. Do you think
you'd be happy doing that?

1684
01:22:37,455 --> 01:22:39,706
Well, I don't know.
What are the hours?
