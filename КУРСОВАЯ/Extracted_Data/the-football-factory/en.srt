1
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,620
<i>These were the scenes
everyone feared.</i>

2
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,880
<i>Running battles
between English and Turkish fans...</i>

3
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,510
<i>...some here have been
seriously injured.</i>

4
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,900
<i>...it's very violent indeed.</i>

5
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,370
<i>Earlier, there was mayhem
on the main square...</i>

6
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,850
<i>Getting beaten up by football hooligans is like
having VD: the fuckin' pain goes on forever.</i>

7
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,720
<i>But that's
what makes it so exciting.</i>

8
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,980
<i>So this is me, Tommy Johnson
three weeks from now, nearly dead.</i>

9
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,610
<i>And do you know what the funniest thing is?
I could see it coming.</i>

10
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,440
<i>Anyway, it's almost over now
and all that matters is this: was it worth it?</i>

11
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,000
<i>There's nothing different about me.</i>

12
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,470
<i>I'm just ahother bored male approaching 30,
in a dead-end job who lives for the weekend.</i>

13
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,680
<i>Casual sex, watered-down lager,
heavily cut drugs.</i>

14
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,020
<i>And occasionally kicking
fuck out of someone.</i>

15
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,050
Zeberdee, it's Bill.

16
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,130
What? How am I?
What do you mean, "how am I"?

17
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,840
I'm fuckin' buzzin'!
We've gone right through the slit.

18
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,640
Keep your fuckin' nut down.

19
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,600
He's a right fuckin' stringer, this kid.

20
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,310
- What's he say?
- Nothing.

21
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,640
- What do you mean, "nothing"?
- He fuckin' hung up.

22
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,440
Raff, call Tommy.
Find out where he is.

23
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,150
There's a pub on the corner called
the Ship and Billet. Head for that.

24
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,990
I'll have to bell you back,
Harris is trying to get through.

25
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:58,070
Just spotted their little firm
going to a pub in Denbigh Street.

26
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,280
They won't know what's fuckin' hit 'em.

27
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,040
There you are.

28
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,710
Here, come here!

29
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,350
- Sweet, Bill?
- Yeah.

30
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,140
- Where's the others?
- On their way.

31
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:32,440
- Harris said there's about 25 of the others.
- There won't be when we've finished with 'em.

32
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,320
Wait round the corner!

33
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,820
What for?

34
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,280
Cos it's all going to be on top,
us all standin' here, you si.

35
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,070
- Jog on.
- Jog on!

36
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,620
Bill, it's Harris.

37
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,620
Hello, son. Yeah?

38
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,210
All right. See you there.

39
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,000
What happened to you last night?
Thought you was coming out for a drink?

40
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,330
Johnson had me on some nutty skunk.

41
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,420
Ended up down the petrol garage
at two o'clock in the morning.

42
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,380
What you driving for?
You're on a ban, you lunatic.

43
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,170
Ban? What am I gonna do, walk?

44
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,930
Here he is.

45
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,560
Right, there's someone
outside the pub.

46
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,650
- How old is he?
- He's only a kid.

47
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,440
Go on, crack him.
Keep the noise down.

48
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,570
<i>Keep the noise down.</i>

49
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:06,580
- Excuse me, mate, you got a light?
- Don't fuck about, ping him.

50
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,450
Let's go!

51
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,420
It's going good anyway.
Let's settle it.

52
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,340
- Come on, let's...
- Keep it down, keep it down.

53
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,920
- Keep it down.
- Fuckin' hell, come on, boys.

54
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,050
Keep it down, keep it down.

55
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,390
- Come on. Fuckin' hell.
- Keep it down.

56
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:30,060
Don't fuck this up.

57
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,480
Fuckin' clowns won't stop us.

58
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,110
You're fuckin' animals!

59
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,900
You give this fuckin' country
a bad fuckin' name!

60
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:28,200
You ain't no football supporters!
You're fuckin' muggy little cunts!

61
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,130
<i>What else are you gonna
do on a Saturday?</i>

62
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:41,090
<i>Sit in your fuckin' armchair wankin' off
to Pop Idols?</i>

63
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,800
<i>Then try and avoid your wife's gaze</i>

64
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,670
<i>as you struggle to come to terms
with your sexless marriage?</i>

65
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,220
<i>Then go and spunk your wages on kebabs
fruit machines and brasses?</i>

66
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,720
<i>Fuck that for a laugh!</i>

67
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,350
<i>I know what I'd rather do.</i>

68
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,270
<i>Tottenham away.
Love it!</i>

69
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,830
How fuckin' perfect was that?

70
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:16,790
Soppy bollocks here even managed to get
the canister inside the fuckin' pub this time.

71
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,620
Do you remember that time at Upton...

72
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:21,250
That time at Upton Park,
he let it off on the tube!

73
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:25,210
Mind you, premature ejaculation,
that's right up your fuckin' street!

74
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:29,890
Anyway, he's virtually throwing 'em
out of the fuckin' pub at me, right?

75
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,560
He's throwing 'em out of the fuckin'
pub at me. Crunch! Crunch!

76
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,690
I hit this geezer so fuckin' hard,
his legs went like a fuckin' baby giraffe.

77
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,650
State of that. I done me knuckles.

78
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,690
So hit people in the mouth,
not the back of the fuckin' head.

79
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,200
Just as well I did or you'd be
in hospital, you cunt.

80
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,700
<i>No-one loved Chelsea
more than me and Rod.</i>

81
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:55,580
<i>We grew up on football terraces together
with my old man. He knew the score.</i>

82
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,370
<i>The first bit of advice
he give me was:</i>

83
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,170
You know what to do
if someone tries to clump you?

84
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,750
Kick him in the fuckin' bollocks.

85
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,000
<i>Me and Rod did everything together.</i>

86
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,010
Hurry up, Tom, I'm starving.

87
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:11,470
<i>It took me an hour just to find it.
Still Rod didn't need to know that.</i>

88
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,260
She ain't walkin' for a week.

89
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,470
<i>My grandad old Bill Farrell,
drove us to drink</i>

90
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,270
<i>with his stories about the war
and how he fought to put the Great into Britain.</i>

91
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:22,520
<i>He said fighting at football was nothing
compared to the Germans.</i>

92
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,570
"We'll fight them on the beaches,
we'll fight them on the..."

93
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:29,320
<i>Although he went on, he was right.
We're an island race. It's what we do best.</i>

94
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,120
<i>It's not about colour or race,
it's just the buzz of being in the front line.</i>

95
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,160
<i>Truth is,
I just love to fight.</i>

96
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,950
<i>There's nothing wrong with me...</i>

97
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:41,040
<i>unlike Billy Bright, whose dad had a funny way
of setting a good example for his son.</i>

98
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,500
Right, that's it.
I'll fight every one of you

99
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,340
before you move on next door to us.
Come on, son!

100
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,420
<i>With parents like that,
he was never gonna end up in Greenpeace.</i>

101
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,930
<i>Still he was one of
the first football thugs</i>

102
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,390
<i>to see there was a fortune to be made
from England's love for ecstasy.</i>

103
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,430
Oi, three bottles of Bud, please, mate.

104
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:01,980
<i>Problem was he'd taken so many beatings on
the terraces that he weren't scared of anyone.</i>

105
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,560
<i>And the correct medical term for that is
a "total fuckin' psycho".</i>

106
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:09,940
Bill, let's get out of here.
There's about ten Stoke fans staring at us.

107
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:13,610
- How many of 'em did you say there was?
- About ten. Please don't start, Bill.

108
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,950
<i>- Right, which one of them's staring at me.
- The big geezer with the Hackett cap on.</i>

109
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,250
See you, you cunt. I'll cut you first.

110
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,080
<i>And that was his idea
of a good day out.</i>

111
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,500
You fuckin' mugs!

112
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:33,380
<i>But underneath the fun and games
and Range Rovers, Blliy was bitter,</i>

113
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,550
<i>cos he hever got to run our firm.</i>

114
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,390
<i>Harris was top boy and that was that.</i>

115
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:40,680
<i>He was smarter than Billy
and ran things like an army unit.</i>

116
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,150
<i>Deep down Billy knew he'd never be leader
and because of that he hated Zeberdee.</i>

117
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,360
<i>Why? Simple...</i>

118
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,780
<i>Zeberdee looked up
to Harris and not him.</i>

119
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,110
<i>And the more Zeberdee looked up to Harris,
the more Billy bullied him.</i>

120
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,450
<i>And what chance did Zeberdee have as a kid,</i>

121
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,580
<i>brought up in a concrete jungle
on glue and hate?</i>

122
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,710
<i>I don't envy the young 'uns any more.
It's a nightmare.</i>

123
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:07,210
<i>Warfare from the playground upwards and you
know what you have to do to survive in combat.</i>

124
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,750
Aargh!

125
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:15,220
<i>Just like me and Rod,
him and Raff are best mates,</i>

126
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,300
<i>only difference being
they're thieving little cunts.</i>

127
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:22,020
<i>In case you're wondering, we call him Zeberdee
cos he loves sniffin' powder.</i>

128
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,770
<i>And one dayn it'll be his downfall.</i>

129
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,820
Hold your hand out, Raff.

130
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,150
- What?
- Hold your hand out.

131
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,160
<i>You're just a fuckin' kid,
ain't you?</i>

132
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,450
Hold your hand out, Bill.

133
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,910
Do what?

134
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,630
Hold it out like Raff
and we'll see how old you are.

135
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,920
Oooh.

136
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,300
<i>No, let's have it right.</i>

137
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,180
You trying to mug me off?

138
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,510
Oh, shut up.
I'm only fuckin' about an' that.

139
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,180
<i>- What d'you mean, "fuckin' about"?
- What?</i>

140
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,600
What d'you mean, "what"?

141
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,690
You know, just...

142
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,730
Well, don't fuckin' just.

143
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:13,280
Leave it out.
You trying to wind me up?

144
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,650
<i>Ain't trying to wind anyone up.</i>

145
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,320
I'm fuckin' serious.

146
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,780
What I want to know is, what makes
you think you can come in here

147
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,490
<i>and mug me off in front of my pals?</i>

148
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,210
I... I didn't mean nothing by it, Bill.

149
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:32,250
It was only a bubble, that's all.

150
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,880
Just a bubble?

151
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,300
What you talking to me
in that fuckin' muggy rhyming slang for?

152
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,550
I never fuckin' liked you,
you little cunt.

153
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,930
<i>You're a wrong 'un,
just like your old man.</i>

154
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,850
<i>He was a degenerate fuckin' drunk.</i>

155
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,430
<i>Do you know what I'm thinking?</i>

156
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,230
<i>I'm thinking I should take you
outside and open you up.</i>

157
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,560
- Leave it out, Bill.
- Leave what fuckin' out?

158
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,860
What, d'you wanna get
involved an' all, do you?

159
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,360
Don't be stupid.
I'm just saying, he's only a kid.

160
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,200
<i>No, let's have it right, Tom.</i>

161
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,200
<i>If he's old enough to run round givin' it large,
fuckin' bashing people up with us,</i>

162
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,330
he's old enough to talk for himself.

163
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,580
I'll tell you something, Zeberfuckindee,

164
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:14,460
<i>I think I should take you outside
and teach you a lesson</i>

165
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:18,470
for mugging me off and making me look a cunt
in front of my fuckin' pals.

166
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,840
I...

167
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,850
I didn't say nothing.

168
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:25,560
Come on, outside,
you little fuckin' stumblebum.

169
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,020
Leave it out, eh?

170
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,730
Stop mutterin' and stutterin'
and fuckin' liven yourself up.

171
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,280
I fuckin' had you there!

172
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,280
Fuckin' hell, Zeb,
you should have seen your fuckin' face.

173
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,700
I thought you was gonna burst into tears.

174
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,040
What is it, four, five...
eight lagers, Donna, please, babe.

175
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,590
There'll be none of this in Australia.

176
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,550
As of next week,
strictly the amber nectar.

177
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:01,340
Not to worry, William.
I think I'm more of a cocktail man anyway.

178
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,260
Well, I won't be sitting next to you.

179
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,720
Well, that was the idea.

180
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,140
Bill, Albert,
I didn't see you there. Wanna pint?

181
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,230
<i>My grandad didn't like Bright.</i>

182
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,390
<i>Knew he was a bully.</i>

183
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,860
<i>Bill and Albert were just kids
when they did their National Service.</i>

184
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:19,070
<i>They were one of the first off the
landing crafts on June 6th.</i>

185
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:23,910
<i>Bill aways told me the only thing that kept him
going was Albert's determination and will to live.</i>

186
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,870
<i>They came home proud war heroes</i>

187
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:28,330
<i>and married
their childhood sweethearts.</i>

188
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,450
<i>And buried 'em together as well.</i>

189
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,750
<i>The council moved Albert to the flat above Bill
and they swapped door keys,</i>

190
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:38,090
<i>always vowing to keep an eye
on each other.</i>

191
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,510
Very funny. Very, very funny!

192
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,300
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

193
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,970
Now a little one. Now a little one.
That's it, now let me get the door.

194
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,770
Let me get the door.
I'll be right in there.

195
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,480
Comfy? Do you want any help with that?

196
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:58,770
<i>Bet you've seen some changes,
eh, you two? Yeah.</i>

197
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,690
Bit different nowadays,
though, innit, eh? Gone.

198
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:06,280
It's the Pakis coming over in the '70s, see.
Taking over everything. Spoilt it.

199
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:09,330
And what you got now, eh?
What you got now?

200
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,290
Fuckin' asylum seekers.

201
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:15,250
Bloody Tony fuckin' Blair.
He's gotta be a poof, ain't he? New Labour?

202
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,540
<i>I mean, and this game's gone.</i>

203
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:22,050
There was a time I used to be able to clear
seven and a half, eight hundred shots a week.

204
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,550
Not any more. Nah.

205
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:28,300
Now what you got is your fuckin' spades
up in Soho moonlighting!

206
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,510
Moonlighting!

207
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,730
Fuck's sake, that's a joke!
You need a full moon just to see 'em!

208
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:36,770
This country was built on
good people like yourselves.

209
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:39,020
Not enough of you about,
that's what I say.

210
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,070
Here, let me give you a hand with that.

211
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:44,530
Swing your old arse round in there, look.
That's it, lovely.

212
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:49,320
And I just want to say, it's been a privilege
to drive two gentlemen like you.

213
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:51,120
And the fare's on me.

214
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,000
Don't be silly.
You're letting the wheelchair fool you.

215
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,830
No, I insist.

216
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,620
<i>It's been an honour.</i>

217
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:03,880
Don't forget, you watch
out for them darkies, eh?

218
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,890
What a wanker.

219
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,600
Let's go dancing.

220
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,980
<i>Although he talked a lot of bollocks,
in some ways the cabbie was right.</i>

221
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:24,230
<i>Bill was what put the Great into Britain.
He was an old war hero.</i>

222
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,650
<i>But he'd moved on.
It was Australia for him and Albert now.</i>

223
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,370
<i>Somewhere they could live out
the rest of their days in the sun.</i>

224
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,580
Hello, Mavis, my little darling.

225
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,250
How are you?

226
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:48,470
I shall be sad to see you both gone, Bill.
Are you packed up yet?

227
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:52,300
Course we have.
Ain't you gonna say goodbye?

228
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,140
Can't you do better than that?

229
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,980
What are you talking about, Bill?

230
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,560
Don't you know?

231
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,610
You fucking disgusting old man!

232
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,570
<i>That's what I loved about Bill.</i>

233
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,360
<i>He was still game.</i>

234
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:12,870
<i>He'd dreamed about. Living abroad for years
and how his time had come.</i>

235
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:16,160
<i>I even give him and Albert a little treat
for going away.</i>

236
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,370
My grandson gave me a going-away present.

237
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:24,420
A joint of his very best home-grown.

238
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,670
You mean drugs?

239
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,970
Yeah, well, you light up old, son.
I'll make do with this.

240
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,770
<i>It's amazing to think
in a couple of weeks</i>

241
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:40,140
we'll be watching the sun go down
on the other side of the world.

242
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,320
And it won't be surrounded
by tower blocks.

243
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:52,990
Miles of golden sand and bronze tits.

244
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,490
You packed yet?

245
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,040
Haven't given it a thought.

246
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,000
My case has been packed
and sitting inside the front door for three days.

247
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,050
You want to get your skates on, Farrell.

248
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,970
Oh, stop nagging, you old woman.

249
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,930
<i>- You know what Bert?
- What's that?</i>

250
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,690
I'm feeling dizzy.

251
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:25,110
<i>You always were, you dozy bastard!</i>

252
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:10,400
<i>The next best thing to violence is sex,</i>

253
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,360
<i>and seeing as there's
nearly 500,000 single women in London,</i>

254
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,200
<i>I must be in with half a chance.</i>

255
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,240
<i>Especially as I'd fuck
anything that's breathing.</i>

256
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,330
I tell you, I'm fuckin' mullered, me.
I am fuckin' mullered.

257
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:30,210
Look at the fuckin' boat on it.
Imagine that round your fuckin' helmet.

258
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:34,010
No, no, no, Tom.
Proper fuckin' slosh pots.

259
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,090
Shut up, you...
What's the matter with you?

260
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,560
All right, sweetheart?
You all right, girl, yeah?

261
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,350
- All right?
- Do you want a drink?

262
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,020
<i>A few tequilas?</i>

263
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,020
A couple of little
cheeky tequilas, yeah?

264
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,190
<i>Shall we get on it?</i>

265
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,030
- A little cheeky tequila...?
- Tequilas.

266
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:53,400
<i>Get these two birds here
a couple of tequilas.</i>

267
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:56,610
I'm gonna smash the fuckin'
granny out of that.

268
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,840
<i>London's changed for the worse.</i>

269
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,970
All the good people, right,
all the good people...

270
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:23,220
are being forced into the suburbs,
due to the influx of illegal immigrants

271
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,890
forcing their way into this country.

272
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,690
<i>- I mean...
- Hey, mate.</i>

273
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:30,060
Mate, will you shut your fuckin' noise?

274
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:05,390
Here you are, sloppy bollocks.
You fuckin' cunt.

275
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,520
Get up there, girl. Get up there.

276
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,940
I cannot wait to fuckin' see your fanny.

277
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,690
I'm gonna fuckin' ruin you...
- Let's have a butcher's here. Rod, look.

278
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,530
- Smash you in the...
- Look at that.

279
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,700
Beautiful, beautiful.

280
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,410
He's only fallen asleep, Tameka.

281
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,540
Same here, Shian. Little fuckers.

282
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,210
Shame. He's hung like a pike in here.

283
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:36,000
Good for you.
I've got a stickleback in here.

284
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,930
You fuckin' little mug!

285
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:51,650
How dare you come into my fuckin' gaff,

286
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:54,860
and try and get hold of my little sister
against her will?

287
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,570
You're in bandit country now, boy,

288
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,860
no-one will even know
you were fuckin' here.

289
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:03,620
There's holes dug all over South London
for people like you.

290
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,250
<i>Jesus.
I was expecting cornflakes and a quick wank.</i>

291
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:15,170
<i>But instead, I get some nutter
in a Stone Island jumper and a blade in my face.</i>

292
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,550
<i>And worst of all,
that was where all the trouble started.</i>

293
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,720
Oi, silly bollocks. What are these?

294
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,930
What?

295
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:28,020
- What are they?
- Flowers.

296
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,730
- What sort of flowers, dinlow?
- Lilies.

297
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,940
Then what are they doing
with the chrysanths?

298
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,400
All right. Sorry.

299
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,940
- What?
- Er... there's someone here to see you, Bill.

300
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,910
Who?

301
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:45,240
<i>...the back door.
Left her watching Blind Date.</i>

302
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,330
<i>Marched on up to The Venus
and bumped into Sonny.</i>

303
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:49,790
<i>He's given me a couple of Es.</i>

304
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,500
<i>I've had them
with a bit more thingy,</i>

305
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,420
and wound up copping for two slosh pots
out of Chigwell.

306
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,710
Smashed the granny out of the pair of 'em
in the Tower Hotel till eleven, Sunday morning.

307
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,970
Yeah, I was back home in time for a Sunday
roast, but I was completely fuckin' anninilated.

308
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:05,510
Look, I've got to go, mate. My man's here.
Ta-da.

309
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,390
Good to see you, son.

310
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,140
<i>- How are you? All right?
- Not bad.</i>

311
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:12,600
Heard you Chelsea boys had a little turnout
at Tottenham at the weekend.

312
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:16,650
You ain't wrong. Heard you Millwall boys
had a little turnout down in Pompey.

313
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:19,440
We did. We should have had a meet.
Would have been fun.

314
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,610
You know where to find us.
Any time you like.

315
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:23,780
Your time'll come.
What have you got for me?

316
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,070
<i>One thing I never understood
about Bright was,</i>

317
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:30,080
<i>although he was in the Chelsea firm,
he did business with the head of their rivals.</i>

318
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,120
<i>Millwall.</i>

319
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,120
<i>Get that.
Two men that work together,</i>

320
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:36,130
<i>then kick fuck out of each other
if ever they get the chance.</i>

321
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,920
It's bang on. What you got round you?

322
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,880
Four K.

323
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,300
- Go on, then. I'll take the lot.
- Cash.

324
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,050
Hang on.

325
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,600
<i>Hang on.</i>

326
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,430
Slow down.

327
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:56,600
What? You're fuckin' joking!

328
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,570
All right.
I'll go straight up the hospital.

329
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,320
<i>Yeah ' see you there.</i>

330
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,530
<i>- Problem, Fred?
- It's my brother, Terry.</i>

331
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:08,030
Someone's just done him round the canister
with a cricket bat.

332
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,950
You're fuckin' joking?
Is he all right?

333
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,450
They don't know yet.

334
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,660
Look, I gotta go.

335
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,460
- I'll keep this lot on ice for you.
- I'll call you later.

336
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:29,510
Oi! What are you fuckin' doing?
You're three hours late.

337
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,470
Don't start, mate. I've had a bit of ag.

338
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,810
What you got a sheet on for?

339
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,140
You don't wanna know.

340
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:39,100
You're right, I don't.
Get in and sort them dinlows out.

341
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:41,360
They're putting lilies
in with the chrysanths.

342
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:44,030
You got anything on under there?

343
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:48,410
<i>What am I fuckin'paying for?
Just get on with it</i>

344
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,590
- What do you reckon, fat boy?
- You look like a vicar, mate.

345
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,390
Are you fuckin' mad?
This is Prada, you cunt.

346
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:12,350
It's iron's gear.

347
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:15,390
Get your fuckin' skates on.
We gotta get there for the draw.

348
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:17,060
Horrible cunt.

349
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:24,940
What about the draw?
How are we gonna find a telly to watch it?

350
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,150
Oh, there'll be tellies where we're going.

351
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,570
<i>Oi, Zeb, try and make sure we've got
a decent house to rob this time, will you?</i>

352
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,490
<i>I don't want to watch
some piece of shit.</i>

353
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:37,660
Slow down, will you, Davis, eh? What's
the matter with you? Are you a fuckin' Hoover?

354
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:40,540
<i>Whether we were thieving,
fucking or fighting tonight,</i>

355
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,880
<i>we'd a be glued to a TV set
to see who Chelsea drew in the Cup.</i>

356
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,630
<i>See, the beauty of the Cup draw is,
it's a lucky dip,</i>

357
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:50,010
<i>a chance to meet one of the old rivals,
like Cardiff or West Ham,</i>

358
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,010
<i>or if you're really lucky,
Millwall.</i>

359
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,890
<i>And cos the draw
meant so much to Billy,</i>

360
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:59,060
<i>he decided to take his long-suffering wife
Barbara out for a quiet, romantic meal.</i>

361
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,190
<i>However,
they got their wires crossed,</i>

362
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:04,440
<i>cos Barbara thought he was taking her
up the West End for some tapas.</i>

363
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,980
Let's see what's on the menu.

364
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:11,160
<i>Oi, it's my sister!</i>

365
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,620
<i>Oh, what, your girfriend?</i>

366
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,500
Oi.

367
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:28,760
Either turn that TV up, or tell that lot down there
to hold their noise down.

368
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,260
Calm down, Bill.

369
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:33,390
We don't want to cause a scene.

370
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,930
No. No, you're right.

371
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:59,830
<i>- The old rubber glove!
- The old rubber glove, mate.</i>

372
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:10,920
Oi!

373
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:15,050
Oi. Will you shut up?
I'm trying to watch the fuckin' telly!

374
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:19,770
<i>...against 52.</i>

375
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:21,560
<i>Southend United.</i>

376
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,230
<i>57.</i>

377
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,060
<i>Portsmouth.</i>

378
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:28,150
<i>Will pay number 38.</i>

379
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:30,150
<i>Middlesbrough.</i>

380
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,650
<i>Number 22.</i>

381
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,860
<i>Millwall.</i>

382
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,700
<i>Will pay 44.</i>

383
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:37,830
<i>Chelsea.</i>

384
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:40,620
Yes! Fuckin' yes!

385
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,960
<i>Another battle then.</i>

386
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,540
Eh? Can't fuckin' hear you.

387
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,670
Who is it, for fuck's sake?

388
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,590
Eh?

389
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,220
Yes!

390
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,760
- Who, who, who?
- It's fuckin' Millwall!

391
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,850
<i>Millwall-Chelsea.
Old enemies that always ends up in murders.</i>

392
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,180
<i>Literally in my case,</i>

393
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:04,140
<i>cos like a mug
I thought I'd get lucky in the same bar again.</i>

394
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:07,440
<i>And I see my new mate again
who, of course, turns out to be Millwall.</i>

395
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,320
<i>Maybe I should ask him if I fucked his sister,
seeing as I can't remember.</i>

396
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:18,700
<i>If I'd listened to my instincts and laid low, none
of this mess would have happened but I didn't,</i>

397
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,280
<i>and I only had myself to blame.</i>

398
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:25,460
<i>And occasionally, and I do mean occasionally,
it would be nice to have Bright out with us.</i>

399
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:28,670
<i>It's typicla that tonight
he's taken his wife out for a quiet one.</i>

400
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:31,050
<i>See? He does have a gentle side.</i>

401
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,000
Aaaarghh!

402
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:35,590
<i>Zeb and Raff missed the draw
cos they were doing what they do best -</i>

403
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:39,300
<i>robbing houses,
something they'd later come to regret.</i>

404
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:43,810
<i>Me, I'm beginning to get the feeling
old Magic Johnson's lost his touch.</i>

405
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,480
Drive, mate! Fuckin' drive.
I'm being chased!

406
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,690
<i>Lost his touch?</i>

407
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,940
<i>Bollocks.</i>

408
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:58,030
Hard to have a nice night
out in London, eh?

409
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,490
I blame all the blacks
and fun pubs, myself.

410
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:04,290
<i>Shut up mate. You're boring.</i>

411
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,000
<i>Welcome back to BBC London Sport
with me, Danny Kelly.</i>

412
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:16,010
<i>Now, anyone who's listened to the Breakfast
Show will have heard Danny Baker going on</i>

413
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:20,840
<i>about his great excitement about the prospects
of Millwall and Chelsea here in London.</i>

414
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:22,930
<i>Our reporter, as always,
is Pete Stevens.</i>

415
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:26,430
<i>That's right, Danny. I'm sure
there's going to be a vast police presence</i>

416
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,190
<i>to keep the we-known hooligan elements apart
from these two teams.</i>

417
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:33,730
<i>I only hope I'm not given the job
of reporting live from South London.</i>

418
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:37,610
<i>I'd much rather be watching the game
from the comfort of my front room.</i>

419
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:51,420
Well, come on, Albert, you old bastard!
We'll miss our flight.

420
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,610
All right, Bill? You look pissed off.

421
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:07,240
No, I'm not fuckin' all right.
Some cunt burgled my house last night.

422
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:09,200
Hold that.

423
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:11,710
<i>Suddenly,
going to Millwall weren't so appealing,</i>

424
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,870
<i>now I knew my enemies were part of their firm</i>

425
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,040
<i>It's the one fuckin' place on earth
I didn't want to be caught out<./i></i>

426
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:20,380
<i>Anyway, Liverpool away, and a chance
to have a good sleep on the coach.</i>

427
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:17,690
Good, this.

428
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:22,360
<i>- What did they nick, Bill?
- TV, DVD...</i>

429
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,490
Even took the fuckin' kids' PlayStation
and my mobile.

430
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,410
<i>- Your mobile?
- Yeah.</i>

431
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:31,700
You know what to do?
Ring your number and see if they've still got it.

432
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:35,500
That'll freak 'em out.
Tell them you know where they live and that.

433
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,580
Good call, Rods.
I've got that Ride Of The Valkyries ring tone.

434
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:41,960
You know, the war cry.
That'll fuckin' freak 'em out.

435
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,220
Hello?

436
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:53,640
You are fuckin' dead meat.

437
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,520
I didn't know it was your house.
I didn't know it was your house!

438
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:05,780
Look, I've got all the gear.
I've got the PlayStation.

439
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:09,780
I'll shall fuckin' open you up!

440
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:21,920
Fuck.

441
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:34,430
Where are you from, mate?

442
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,480
Just around.

443
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,940
Are you fookin' Chelsea?

444
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,440
Yeah.

445
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,360
You flash cockney bastards.
Do you know Stanley?

446
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,820
Run!

447
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,660
Go on, run, you pair of rats.

448
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,160
<i>Drive on again mate. Drive on.</i>

449
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:03,210
Hey! Stop the fuckin' bus, you cunt!

450
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,590
Fuckin' come on!

451
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,150
Where the fuck are you running now?

452
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,730
Cunts! Fuckin' cunts!

453
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:33,620
Go on. Fuck off!

454
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:39,200
Come here.
You didn't fuckin' shine there, did you, son?

455
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:40,330
What?

456
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:44,080
I've got to go to work on him now,
stop him opening you up.

457
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:46,050
You silly bollocks.

458
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:47,760
What was all that about?

459
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,340
But we did 'em, didn't we, H?

460
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,890
<i>Billy had a real punishmeht lined up
for Zeberdee.</i>

461
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:57,010
<i>He weren't the forgiving type, but as long
as Harris was around, he couldn't touch him.</i>

462
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:00,480
<i>And Harris and Billy
certainy didn't need another reason to fall out.</i>

463
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:24,420
Right. No thieving.
No bringing attention to yourselves.

464
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,830
Just keep your nuts down.

465
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,000
I want you to be outside and back on the road
in five minutes.

466
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:31,470
Oh, yeah, and whatever you do, no fighting.

467
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:34,090
Bit rich, coming from him, innit?

468
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:41,640
Zeb, what did Billy say to you?

469
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:44,310
He said we've got to get his gear back to him
by tomorrow.

470
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,940
And we've got to apologise to his wife and kids.

471
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:50,480
You've had a result there.
You're lucky. He could have battered you.

472
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:52,110
Blinding result, eh?

473
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:56,870
This complete nutter will never talk to us again,
and everyone think s we're thieving little cunts.

474
00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:01,290
<i>You are thieving little cunts.
But you know what you've got to do, don't you?</i>

475
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:03,910
Prove yourself at Millwall.
That'll sort it out.

476
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,710
Yeah, do the business down there,
and you'll be an hero in his eyes.

477
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,450
Will you stop moaning about beer?
All you do is complain about beer.

478
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:38,660
I'll be opening bottles with my fuckin' teeth
all the way up there, Bill.

479
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,580
Could have done with a couple of cans.

480
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,700
Shouldn't have had that chicken burger.

481
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:45,330
Stone me, it's them Stoke fans that done us.

482
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,750
- Where?
- Over there. Look. It's them.

483
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:50,750
<i>- It is them.
- It is an' all.</i>

484
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,010
On the Rory, on the Rory, on the Rory.

485
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:56,380
Listen. We'll get the beers safe.
Then we'll outflank 'em, yeah?

486
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:58,550
I ain't saying a word.

487
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,350
What the fuck are you doing?

488
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:02,430
There's two of them
Stoke fans that done us.

489
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:04,930
Drop 'em now. We'll be late for the meet.

490
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:07,230
Fuck 'em. They kicked the shit out of us.

491
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:10,190
<i>No. The gavvers are over there.</i>

492
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,520
<i>I'll give you fuckin' "no"!</i>

493
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,120
Northern cunt!

494
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,170
Fuckin' idiots.

495
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,090
Slow down, you two, for fuck's sake!

496
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:39,890
What, was you fuckin' bullied at school,
was you?

497
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,600
Have fun, boys.

498
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,650
Who are you fuckin' looking at?

499
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:58,070
<i>Billy's extensive vocabulary
would never get him into Parliament.</i>

500
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:02,120
<i>And this lot could be West Ham,
Cardiff, Arsenal, Stoken even Man United.</i>

501
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,990
<i>Don't matter to me.
The odds don't look very good.</i>

502
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,880
Know what? I think I'll call it a night. Tom?

503
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:19,630
Yeah, let's go and have a beer.

504
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,430
Yeah, good idea. We'll jog on.
What about you, Tom?

505
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:25,470
All right, boys. I'll see you in a bit.
Order us some Miller.

506
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,350
- Light?
- Er... regular.

507
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:31,230
- No problem.
- See you later.

508
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,360
You all right down there, mister?

509
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:23,950
<i>What happened to you?</i>

510
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:28,290
I've had the shit kicked out of me.
What about you?

511
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,870
Me? I'm dead.

512
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,500
Bill! Rod!

513
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,960
Help! Where are you?

514
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:40,670
Bill! Help!

515
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,930
Fuckin' hell.

516
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:47,350
Liven yourself up.
We're in court in half an hour.

517
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:48,720
Court? What?

518
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:51,850
Fuck... What about my dream?

519
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:56,560
<i>What the fuck was that dream a about?
Who was the pikey kid with the bandaged face?</i>

520
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:59,020
<i>Where was that tunnel?
What did i all mean?</i>

521
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:02,400
<i>Fuck it.
Must be that nutty skunk again.</i>

522
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:05,700
What's wrong with you, Bright?
You're 40 years old,

523
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:08,530
<i>and still you offend persistently.</i>

524
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,490
I see children with more common sense.

525
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,290
<i>What did you say?</i>

526
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:17,210
Don't you dare answer me with that
insolent tongue of yours, you fat fucking slob!

527
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:21,380
<i>The Establishment call us chidren while
they're at King's Cross having sex with 'em.</i>

528
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,300
<i>I should tell this old queer
to join us down at Millwall.</i>

529
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,140
<i>He might enjoy swapping that silly wig
for having a row.</i>

530
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:31,470
Yes, sir. I'm very sorry, sir. It won't happen
again, sir. You can be sure of that.

531
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,810
I do hope that's the case, Mr Bright.
I'm passing this over for reports.

532
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,560
<i>I'll see you
in a month for sentence.</i>

533
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:38,480
<i>- And Bright
- Yes, sir?</i>

534
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,150
If you appear before me
again before that date,

535
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:45,240
<i>I won't hesitate to give you
a custodial sentence of a least five years...</i>

536
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,370
<i>Why is it, while I'm having hightmares
about dead kids,</i>

537
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:51,580
<i>Rod's slipping into the court clerk?
What's he got I'm missing?</i>

538
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:54,540
<i>Shame. He's hung like a pike in here.</i>

539
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:57,460
<i>And it's tricky
cos he's been known to get serious.</i>

540
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:12,180
How are the tulips selling?
They flew out at the market.

541
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,770
What's happening, Tom?

542
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:18,980
Here. I got nicked with Bright the other day,
kicking off with the OB. You'd have loved it.

543
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:23,030
Nice one, Tom. Sounds really clever.
It's not my scene any more.

544
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:25,820
Yeah, well, I'm just saying.

545
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:30,030
Well, go and say it somewhere else, and don't
come down my stall giving it the big 'un.

546
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,280
All right. Slow down, Ad.

547
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:34,580
Slow down?
I'll tell you about fuckin' "slow down".

548
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:38,920
What's the matter with you, clumping people?
Ain't it about time you started growing up?

549
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,130
You're nearly 30. You wanna get hold
of yourself. It's all a lot of bollocks, anyway.

550
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:46,760
- What?
- You're a bright kid. Work it out.

551
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:53,510
- Here you are.
- No, they're from both of us.

552
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:04,650
Tommy... think about it.

553
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,410
<i>Nearly 30? What's he on about?</i>

554
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:13,490
<i>Jesus! I only wanted a bunch of fuckin' flowers,
and he tells me to think about my life.</i>

555
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:30,380
See you, Albert.

556
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:49,320
What's Harris and Bright doing there?

557
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,490
I could hardly stop them, Bill.

558
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:55,490
They're foolish men, Tom.

559
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:59,000
Harris think s we're connected
cos I fought in the war.

560
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:04,290
What he doesn't understand is, I fought to stop
people like him with their Fascist opinions.

561
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,340
Billy is a fuckin' idiot.

562
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:11,800
Are you still going to Australia?

563
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:16,010
I don't know. There's a spare ticket
going begging, if you're interested.

564
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:19,930
Your cousins would love to see you.

565
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,150
Do yourself a favour.

566
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:28,110
Put a bit of distance between you
and all that stuff you're mixed up in.

567
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:31,530
I'm all right, Bill.

568
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,200
I'm just having a laugh.

569
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,320
Well, just be careful.

570
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,370
Next time you visit the boneyard,
it could be in a box.

571
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:10,860
What are you fuckin' doing here,
you little cunt?

572
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:13,240
I've come to pay my respects.

573
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,700
Well, you're not wanted.

574
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:20,240
Let's have it right. You didn't even
fuckin' know him, did you? Did you?

575
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:25,170
Well, put your soppy cap on,
then, and fuck off.

576
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:29,460
Go on, jog on.

577
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:32,590
Don't forget our appointment.

578
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:55,240
All right, boys? What's happening?

579
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,780
Why have you got a dartboard
drawn on your shirt, Zeb?

580
00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:00,280
Well, what's it got
to do with you, you mug?

581
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:07,460
All right, boys. First one to a hundred.

582
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:11,300
Aaaarghh!

583
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,630
Aaaarghh!

584
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:16,010
Stand up straight.

585
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:25,310
He wants to know
which one stole the PlayStation.

586
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:29,730
Me.

587
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:34,320
Good call. Crack on.

588
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:37,150
Aaaarghh!

589
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,320
Oi, shithead, hold your hand out.

590
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:42,580
- What, Zeb?
- I said, hold your hand out.

591
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,710
Just a kid, ain't you?

592
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:52,290
<i>You hold your hand out, Zeb.
Let's see how old you are.</i>

593
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,300
Are you trying to fuckin' mug me off?

594
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:06,140
<i>With Millwall round the corner,
it was time for the juniors to play</i>

595
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:09,350
<i>Nice to see Billy and Fred
could put their differences aside</i>

596
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,610
<i>when it come to their kids.</i>

597
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:16,240
Bit of a coincidence, eh? Our kids play against
each other just before we meet in the Cup.

598
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:19,780
Somehow, I don't think this game's
gonna get quite as messy. Do you?

599
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,870
Fancy yourselves in bandit country, then?

600
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:25,410
Well, let's have it right.
If history's anything to go by,

601
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:28,080
last time we met you lot,
we ran you all over London.

602
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,080
You couldn't run 100 yards, mate!

603
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:33,840
- Won't fuckin' need to, either!
- Don't get lemon, Bill. It don't suit you.

604
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,250
Spell it, you cunt.

605
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:37,170
C-U-N-T. Cunt.

606
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,340
I meant "lemon", soppy bollocks.

607
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:44,300
We'll see about lemon when you're lost
in deep south, you fat fuckin' prick.

608
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:47,770
Whoa! Now we're getting personal.
Now, what's your problem?

609
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:51,560
That you have to open your kebab shop soon
or that you buy Charlie off a white man?

610
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:57,150
Well, how does it feel doing business with
a Turk, when you're supposed to be right wing?

611
00:46:57,230 --> 00:46:59,030
Scooby-Do's less confused than you.

612
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:01,450
You'll be confused
when I open your canister up.

613
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:03,700
You wanna wait
till the game or make one now?

614
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:07,080
Don't punch above your weight,
you long streak of piss.

615
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,000
Well, stop punching your old woman about,
then, wanker.

616
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,710
What did you fuckin' say, you mug?

617
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:14,380
You fuckin' heard,
you fat fuckin' Johnson cunt.

618
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:17,420
Fuckin' mug! Look at you, you cunt!

619
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:20,260
Get off me, you... Get off me, you cunt!

620
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:26,760
Fuck this.
If they can't be grown up, let's go.

621
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:28,600
I'll fuckin' do you!

622
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:43,950
<i>Just as I thought.
Rod's been plating the court clerk's Gary,</i>

623
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:46,450
<i>and now she wants
to meet his mates.</i>

624
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:51,250
<i>I told him I already met her in the dock,
but he insisted on a social one.</i>

625
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:56,000
<i>And why is it that when your best mate meets
a girl, he quickly changes into a fuckin' melt,</i>

626
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:59,300
<i>and acts like
he's only known you for ten minutes?</i>

627
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:03,300
So... what do you do, then, Thomas?

628
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,550
<i>Thomas?
Kick people's fuckin' heads in for a laugh.</i>

629
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,060
<i>And you shoud know, div.
You read the charges out.</i>

630
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:10,970
Me?

631
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:12,980
I work long and hard.

632
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:18,520
Sounds like Rod!

633
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,700
<i>Yeah?</i>

634
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:29,700
Cor...

635
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:32,960
<i>Jesus, he's really picked one here.
The worst sort of all.</i>

636
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:37,580
<i>Wannabe middle-class scum.
I'd like to kick the cunt back to Penge.</i>

637
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:39,090
Seems nice.

638
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:41,460
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, he's a top bloke.

639
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:44,510
Bill, it's Tom. Fancy a quiet drink?
I'm bored out of my skull.

640
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:47,590
Meet me at work
around seven in the morning.

641
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,720
Don't worry. I'll bring my tools.

642
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:54,100
- Fancy a sauna?
- Good call, Bill.

643
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:10,200
Johnson!

644
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,290
Johnson!

645
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:16,830
All right, Billy. What's it gonna be today?
A little lavender head massage?

646
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,130
No, forget that and just crack straight on
with the blow job, eh?

647
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:24,510
Stone me, she won't be working for a week.
What was that screaming about?

648
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:26,090
- What do you think?
- Good boy.

649
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:29,800
<i>What do you think the screaming was about?
I'm having a fuckin' breakdown.</i>

650
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:34,850
<i>With my back against the wall there was
only one thing for it: seek counsle from Bright.</i>

651
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,850
Bill, can I talk to you for a minute?

652
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:40,110
Yeah, yeah, course you can, son.

653
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:43,480
It's just er... I keep...

654
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:48,160
I dunno. I just keep... You know?

655
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,120
Yeah, yeah, I know.

656
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,660
<i>- Really?
- Yeah, I know.</i>

657
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,080
Fuck! Fuck it.
I thought it was just me.

658
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:03,960
No, listen.
It happens to me all the time.

659
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:06,340
No, don't worry about it. It's sweet.

660
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,090
Don't worry. I'm gonna sort you out.

661
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:10,260
Thank s, Bill.
You're a fuckin' good man.

662
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,850
Listen. Don't mention it.

663
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:15,140
<i>- Here you are.
- What?</i>

664
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:16,850
<i>Go on son. Crack on. Go on.</i>

665
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:27,190
Enjoy!

666
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,370
<i>Should have seen that one coming.</i>

667
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:34,660
<i>The last person on earth you want to talk to
when you're paranoid</i>

668
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,620
<i>Ask Bright for advice, and
you get fuckin' Viagra.</i>

669
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:15,370
<i>And what a good mate he was
in my time of need.</i>

670
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:19,000
<i>Fuckin' fat little cunt
lazing about with his Penge minge.</i>

671
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,210
Wake up, sleepy.

672
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:23,580
That was my parents on the phone.

673
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:26,590
They're coming to London at the weekend
and want to take us out.

674
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:29,420
Well, as long as it ain't Saturday.
We got Millwall.

675
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:31,260
It is Saturday, Rod.

676
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:40,430
What about Sunday?

677
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:45,110
They're going to my brother's in Reading.
Don't tell me you'd rather go to football.

678
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:46,480
Well, I am male.

679
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:48,730
It's one game.

680
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:50,320
I am male.

681
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,910
But my parents only come round
once every few months.

682
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:55,740
Yeah, Millwall comes round
less than the eclipse, babe.

683
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:58,370
Well, don't just run out.

684
00:51:58,450 --> 00:52:01,830
<i>- I'm going to work.
- Let's talk about it, eh?</i>

685
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,370
There's nothing to talk about.

686
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:06,920
<i>You either meet my parents on Saturday
or you never meet them.</i>

687
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,400
All right, boys?

688
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,030
Yeah. Sweet. Speak to you later.

689
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,240
Fuck off.

690
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:45,330
- Are you serving?
- Yeah, what do you need? Whites or browns?

691
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,630
Hit him, hit him! Hit the cunt.

692
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,460
Come here.

693
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:54,380
Cunt! Cunt! Cunt!

694
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:57,970
Grab the fuckin' rock.
Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

695
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:03,850
Cunt!

696
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,560
Come on!

697
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:18,870
- Fuckin' hell!
- Shit, that must have been Zeberdee.

698
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:20,580
Come, let's go.

699
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:23,060
<i>My grandad's life
was disappearing in front of his eyes.</i>

700
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:27,940
<i>With Albert dead, he had no-one, apart from me,
so it was time to give him some family support,</i>

701
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:30,520
<i>and maybe even
some friendly advice.</i>

702
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:34,440
You should come to Millwall at the weekend.
That'll liven you up a bit.

703
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:43,530
You all right for money, Bill?

704
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:45,910
<i>Cos you know
you've only got to ask.</i>

705
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:48,500
<i>I'm earning a few quid
down the market now.</i>

706
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:50,330
It ain't as if I got
a bird to spend it on.

707
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:51,630
Unlike Rod.

708
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:55,000
You sound over the moon about that.

709
00:54:55,090 --> 00:54:56,710
Yeah, well...

710
00:54:58,970 --> 00:55:00,800
Your chance'll come.

711
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:07,600
Don't you ever get the itch?

712
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:10,600
Yeah.

713
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,270
I can see myself on a sun lounger
in my back garden,

714
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:16,820
a couple of kids running about...

715
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:18,940
sipping my Pimm's quietly.

716
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:21,280
Kids, eh?

717
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,780
Yeah. Why not?

718
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:25,200
What's their names?

719
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,500
Dorian, after my mate.

720
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:30,080
Dorian?

721
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:33,170
<i>Both of them?</i>

722
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:34,290
Yeah, probably.

723
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:35,960
What if they're girls?

724
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,220
Dorian.

725
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:43,890
You're a good boy, Tom.

726
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:47,720
Keep your eye on my wallet, Bill.

727
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:49,640
I'm going to the toilet.

728
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:09,580
I tell you what, Fred.

729
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:12,580
<i>This area beats
South London hands down.</i>

730
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:17,170
Bollocks, does it.
I'll have Bermondsey any day.

731
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:20,880
It's full of spivs and skint
hoorays round here.

732
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:25,140
I just wanna find this fuckin' Tommy Johnson
and get out of here.

733
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:27,930
Let's just cut him
and fuck off back over south.

734
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:29,720
<i>You're not wrong.</i>

735
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:34,600
Oi, you, skint boat, come here.

736
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:38,730
- Me?
- Yes, fuckin' you. Come here.

737
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,070
Come on.

738
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:48,030
Ever heard of a geezer
called Tommy Johnson?

739
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:50,990
Johnson...

740
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:53,710
Johnson...

741
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,580
No, I've never heard of him, mate.

742
00:56:57,670 --> 00:56:58,960
Yeah?

743
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,460
Yeah.

744
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:03,050
<i>So, what's your name?</i>

745
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:06,800
- What?
- I said, what's your fuckin' name?

746
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:10,470
Dorian.

747
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:13,230
Poof!

748
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:17,020
Dorian? Sounds like a fuckin' poof.

749
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,020
Yeah, I know.

750
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:20,610
Just a name, though, innit?

751
00:57:20,690 --> 00:57:22,110
Prove it.

752
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:25,070
Prove what?

753
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:27,570
Stop fuckin' stuttering,
and fuckin' prove it.

754
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:29,740
Just show him some fuckin' brief.

755
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,330
Er...

756
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:35,790
I ain't got my wallet on me, mate.

757
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:43,300
Go on, then. Fuck off, you mug. Go on.

758
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:46,260
Hang on.

759
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:52,060
<i>We'll see who the fuck you really are.
Give us your phone.</i>

760
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:00,480
<i>Who's this?</i>

761
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,780
<i>Hello. It's Rod. Is Dorian there?</i>

762
00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:08,780
You've had a fuckin' touch. Little mug.

763
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,700
<i>Come on. Let's go.</i>

764
00:58:21,090 --> 00:58:23,340
Do you reckon he's somewhere else?

765
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:26,300
We'll try the other gaff.
He's got to be here somewhere.

766
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,480
<i>Fuckin' hell!
Did your arse drop, son?</i>

767
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:47,360
You'd fuckin' think so! I tell you.

768
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:51,620
The moment I seen them follow you in,
I knew you'd give them a dodgy name.

769
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:53,910
It's a little trick
we picked up in the army.

770
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:57,120
I'm definitely calling my kids Dorian now.
Dorian.

771
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,790
<i>- Dorian.
- Dorian.</i>

772
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:03,000
See you, Rodder, I fuckin' love you
sometimes. Do you know that?

773
00:59:03,090 --> 00:59:05,500
You ain't too bad yourself, Johnson.

774
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:08,800
I'm well up for it now.
The omens are good. Millwall who?

775
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:11,340
<i>I'm gonna have a right
fuckin' buzz down there.</i>

776
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:13,430
Yeah.

777
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:17,140
<i>Don't say it, Rod.</i>

778
00:59:18,270 --> 00:59:19,940
What?

779
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:21,600
You fuckin' know.

780
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:25,190
Look, Tom, fuckin'...
Her mum and dad are coming down.

781
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,280
Tom, you'll need these
where you're going.

782
01:00:04,650 --> 01:00:06,190
How you doing, mister?

783
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:08,900
Nah. Not good. You?

784
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:10,610
Still dead.

785
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:13,530
Sorry about that. Am I?

786
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:15,820
No, you're still alive.

787
01:00:15,910 --> 01:00:18,990
<i>- Who are you, mate?
- Don't know mate.</i>

788
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,540
Can't tell till I
take these bandages off.

789
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,440
What?

790
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:54,570
What do you mean, "what"?

791
01:00:56,490 --> 01:00:58,450
What are you looking at me like that for?

792
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:00,290
You don't know?

793
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:02,790
What, Rod?

794
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:05,250
You don't remember what
you done last night?

795
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,210
I was fuckin' lashed, wasn't I?

796
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:19,180
Last thing I remember was being in the boozer
with you and my grandad.

797
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:20,930
Jesus, Tom...

798
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:24,480
For fuck's sake, Rod, what's so bad?

799
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:26,100
You don't remember Barbara?

800
01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:29,060
Barbara who?

801
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:31,440
You tried to get off
with Billy's wife.

802
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:34,400
Fuck off.

803
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:36,570
And when she blanked you, you beat her up.

804
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:41,040
- What?
- You broke her fuckin' jaw, Tom.

805
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:45,160
I know you're winding me up, Rod.

806
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:49,790
Please tell me you're winding me up, Rod.

807
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,630
I ain't, mate.

808
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:57,510
Fuck off, King. I tell you what.
I'll ring Zeb. He'll fuckin' know.

809
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:02,970
All right, Zeb?

810
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:06,270
Fuckin' hell, Tom.
I don't know what to say.

811
01:02:07,770 --> 01:02:09,190
<i>You went berserk mate.</i>

812
01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:13,610
<i>I've got to wash my hands of this one.
The cunt's been playing darts with me.</i>

813
01:02:18,910 --> 01:02:20,570
What am I gonna do, Rod?

814
01:02:21,830 --> 01:02:23,620
You're gonna have to go round there.

815
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:26,460
What?

816
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:28,750
Just go round there and fuckin' beg.

817
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:32,590
Well, that's a good idea. I might as well
break her fuckin' nose while I'm at it.

818
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:35,050
I don't know what else to say to you, Tom.

819
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:36,920
No, you're right. I'll...

820
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:41,600
I'll fling myself on my knees
and let him kick the fuck out of me.

821
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:44,220
Hopefully, he'll have mercy on me
if I'm on the floor.

822
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:47,940
You know him better than me, mate.

823
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:51,440
That's the problem. I know what he'll do.

824
01:03:32,190 --> 01:03:33,270
Johnson.

825
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:38,820
Listen, Bill, listen.
On my life, I don't remember nothing.

826
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:41,780
I was obviously smashed out of my tree.
I've woke up...

827
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:44,120
I'm none the wiser, Bill. Please, Bill.

828
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:47,750
<i>I don't know what's gone on, mate
swear to you. Please Bill. Please.</i>

829
01:03:47,830 --> 01:03:49,250
My life.

830
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:56,920
You soppy, muggy streak of piss.
I can't fuckin' believe you fell for that!

831
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:02,930
If you'd touched my woman,
you'd already be dead!

832
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:04,720
Fuckin' arseholes.

833
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:06,260
<i>Fuckin' funny, that, innit?</i>

834
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:10,810
Go on. Have a fuckin' laugh, will you?
Go on. Really fuckin'...

835
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:13,060
I really fuckin' need this at the moment,

836
01:04:13,150 --> 01:04:17,480
what with my dreams,
fuckin' florists, fuckin' billboards...

837
01:04:17,570 --> 01:04:18,570
Bollocks!

838
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:21,780
Cunts.

839
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:23,410
On his fuckin' knees!

840
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:34,830
<i>With mates like mine
you certainly don't need enemies. Jesus.</i>

841
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:37,000
<i>Three weeks ago,
I was getting on with my life.</i>

842
01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:41,170
<i>But now, with Millwall round the corner,
I'm half the man I was, which ain't saying much.</i>

843
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:43,300
<i>And the worst is yet to come.</i>

844
01:04:44,470 --> 01:04:46,050
<i>Here's Mark with the sport.</i>

845
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:48,390
<i>Well, the third round
takes place this Saturday,</i>

846
01:04:48,470 --> 01:04:51,890
<i>and of course the pick of the ties
has got to be Chelsea against Millwall.</i>

847
01:04:51,980 --> 01:04:55,400
<i>I know police leave
is cancelled, but this goes beyond that.</i>

848
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,110
<i>This is that ancient rivalry...</i>

849
01:04:57,190 --> 01:04:58,440
Hello, Bill.

850
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:01,110
Donna, give him a pint, love.
Put 'em on the tab.

851
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:04,530
- How's your luck?
- Not bad, Billy. How are you?

852
01:05:07,450 --> 01:05:08,830
<i>Right. Same as before.</i>

853
01:05:08,910 --> 01:05:11,540
I'll take some of you lot
down through South Bermondsey,

854
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:14,210
and Tommy will take the
rest from Surrey Quays.

855
01:05:15,170 --> 01:05:16,670
Where's the meet?

856
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:18,250
It can't be too far away.

857
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:20,500
They'll have spotters
out all over the place.

858
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:23,670
<i>- And it's on top of the Old Bill before we start.
- What about Billy?</i>

859
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,050
What about Billy?

860
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:28,100
He knows Millwall
like the back of his hand.

861
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:31,350
Fuck Billy.
He don't know what he's doing any more.

862
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:35,940
Now, let's have it right.
We all know he's become a liability.

863
01:05:36,020 --> 01:05:38,610
<i>Granted, yeah he can have a row.</i>

864
01:05:38,690 --> 01:05:40,900
But he can't run a turnout
down in South London.

865
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:44,150
<i>He's a fuckin' lunatic.
Look what happened in Liverpool.</i>

866
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:45,610
Bollocksed the day up.

867
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:50,200
His problem is,
he's taken too much of that shit up his nose.

868
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:53,410
Just forget him.

869
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:55,210
Slow down. He's one of your own.

870
01:05:55,290 --> 01:05:57,370
<i>Hang on.
You've got to make Harris right here.</i>

871
01:05:57,460 --> 01:06:00,630
It's like having a big kid around.
He's a fuckin' dope, mate.

872
01:06:00,710 --> 01:06:04,090
<i>Just let him take Zeberdee
and those chavvies. That'll do him.</i>

873
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:06,130
<i>You just wipe your mouth of him.</i>

874
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:07,970
He's a spent force.

875
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:37,580
<i>Bill...</i>

876
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,750
<i>Bill!</i>

877
01:06:49,470 --> 01:06:50,760
What's the matter, babe?

878
01:06:51,890 --> 01:06:54,390
You think I'm all right, don't you?

879
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:55,680
What?

880
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,270
I'm all right, aren't I?

881
01:06:58,350 --> 01:07:00,400
Yeah, course you are, you silly sod.

882
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:03,610
Come here.

883
01:07:06,990 --> 01:07:08,610
Eat your dinner.

884
01:07:26,090 --> 01:07:27,090
Bright!

885
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:31,390
Don't fuckin' creep up
on me like that, you si!

886
01:07:31,470 --> 01:07:32,930
Bill. Take it easy.

887
01:07:33,010 --> 01:07:35,220
How comes you weren't down the pub
last night?

888
01:07:35,310 --> 01:07:36,930
Fell asleep, didn't I?

889
01:07:39,270 --> 01:07:41,440
<i>How comes you know I weren't there?</i>

890
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,480
Harris belled me and asked where you were.

891
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:46,320
<i>Well, he didn't fuckin' bell me.
Maybe he forgot, eh?</i>

892
01:07:51,410 --> 01:07:53,120
<i>- Got it?
- Fuck me! What's that for?</i>

893
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,530
Millwall.

894
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:57,490
Don't be stupid.
You can't take a gun down there.

895
01:07:57,580 --> 01:08:01,170
- It's only a flare gun.
- What are you on about? You'll kill someone.

896
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:03,330
<i>Meant to be having
a laugh aren't we?</i>

897
01:08:06,050 --> 01:08:07,300
Fuckin' hell, Bill.

898
01:08:09,470 --> 01:08:10,920
You're on the turn, ain't you?

899
01:08:11,010 --> 01:08:13,550
<i>- You ain't got nothing to prove.
- Ain't I?</i>

900
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:45,000
You look as handsome
as you did on our wedding day.

901
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:47,460
<i>Where are your medals?</i>

902
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:49,880
You can't go
to Whitehall without them, dear.

903
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,090
<i>You're a hero William.
Go and put them on dear.</i>

904
01:08:55,180 --> 01:08:56,970
Make me the proudest woman alive.

905
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:27,880
Don't look at me.

906
01:09:41,470 --> 01:09:43,350
Yeah, go on. Fuck off, you Pakis.

907
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:47,600
Fuck off!

908
01:09:47,690 --> 01:09:50,770
Got the little chavvy?
Corned beefs all over the gaff.

909
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:52,320
I know, I know, I know.

910
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:55,150
Did you see the state of his boat?
Did you see it?

911
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:02,950
You don't even know you're fuckin' born!

912
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:04,750
Oh, fuck off.

913
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:25,730
Go on, fuck off, you old mug!

914
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:13,860
I know who I am now.

915
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:16,690
Show me, then.

916
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:41,760
All right, for fuck's sake.

917
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:47,220
Hurry up, lazy bollocks.
It's Millwall today.

918
01:11:48,890 --> 01:11:49,890
You all right?

919
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:52,900
I'm sweet, mate. I'm fuckin' buzzing.
This is it.

920
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:56,860
What's wrong?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

921
01:11:59,030 --> 01:12:01,200
Listen, Zeb. Listen, listen.

922
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:02,950
You... You'd better just...

923
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:06,580
What, Tom?
Fucking hell, Tom, what had I better do?

924
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:10,750
Just look after yourself.
It might turn ugly.

925
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:13,960
Don't worry about me.
I'm gonna be a fuckin' hero.

926
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:16,340
Liven up, we've got to meet the others.

927
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:20,760
I tell you, it's a fuckin' buzz! Come on!

928
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:06,390
Here, Tom, where's Rod?

929
01:13:06,470 --> 01:13:08,970
Fuck knows. You all right?

930
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:11,850
Yeah. Couldn't sleep, could I?
Fuckin' buzzing.

931
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:30,330
<i>The wretch from Penge had got her claws in,
and only a miracle could bring him back.</i>

932
01:13:30,410 --> 01:13:33,580
<i>But I couldn't see it happening.
I'd lost him when I needed him most.</i>

933
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:37,710
<i>And not even someone of Rod's calibre
woud have the bottle to say...</i>

934
01:13:37,790 --> 01:13:40,250
That espresso's really kicked in.

935
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:42,300
<i>Darling you don't drink espresso.</i>

936
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:55,770
Tell me more about the air conditioning,
Rodney. I'm fascinated.

937
01:13:56,690 --> 01:13:58,980
Air conditioning?

938
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:01,980
You told me you run an
air-conditioning firm.

939
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:05,650
Well, we have a few vans out on jobs at once
most of the time.

940
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:07,700
Well, it's always busier in the summer.

941
01:14:07,780 --> 01:14:10,240
Nothing like a soaring temperature
to help the work.

942
01:14:10,330 --> 01:14:14,200
Anyway, most of the time I just sit
around the office, waiting for the weekend.

943
01:14:14,290 --> 01:14:17,330
Don't get me wrong.
I love the money the job pays.

944
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:22,000
But my real passion lies
in kicking people's fucking heads in at football.

945
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:25,840
See, I've got to channel it somewhere,
and as you can tell by my bulging stomach,

946
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:28,720
I don't participate in too
many sporting activities.

947
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,970
And I don't do drugs.

948
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:33,180
Well, that's not entirely true,
but not a lot.

949
01:14:33,270 --> 01:14:37,190
So, I need my release, and a good fuckin' fight
seems the best way. Wouldn't you agree?

950
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:39,940
<i>Maybe not</i>

951
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:44,900
At least I wouldn't be walking around like you -
fuckin' horrible cunts with sticks up your arses,

952
01:14:44,990 --> 01:14:48,030
trying to pretend your little
suburban nightmare's all right.

953
01:14:48,110 --> 01:14:50,700
<i>Then again,
it just depends which way you look at it.</i>

954
01:14:50,780 --> 01:14:53,040
Mate, can we have the...

955
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:56,370
No, I'll...

956
01:15:10,510 --> 01:15:13,560
Rod! I fuckin' knew you'd make it!

957
01:15:14,770 --> 01:15:16,680
Wouldn't miss it for the world, mate.

958
01:15:17,850 --> 01:15:20,020
There's a fuckin' shot, man.

959
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:45,630
You lot fuckin' ready for us, or what?

960
01:15:45,670 --> 01:15:48,010
Well, let's see how game you really are.

961
01:15:49,430 --> 01:15:52,220
So, come and find us, then, shithead.

962
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:55,850
Oh, and be careful.
Remember you're gonna be in deep south.

963
01:15:55,930 --> 01:15:58,810
Away from all the crowds
and the ready eye.

964
01:15:58,850 --> 01:16:00,440
So, watch your fuckin' backs.

965
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:03,310
<i>- Fuckin' hell!
- Let's have it!</i>

966
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:24,590
Hello, Tom.

967
01:16:24,670 --> 01:16:25,960
What's happening, Joe boy?

968
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,550
Everything's sweet round here.

969
01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:30,010
- Where's Harris?
- On his way from South Bermondsey.

970
01:16:30,050 --> 01:16:32,050
Get yourself up on the bridge lively.

971
01:16:32,090 --> 01:16:33,300
Later on. Bye.

972
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:42,270
- Hello, Joe, son. Where are you?
- On the bridge. It's all quiet down here.

973
01:16:42,310 --> 01:16:44,480
Keep your eyes peeled.
We´ll be there soon.

974
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,230
<i>Give you a bell if I see anything.</i>

975
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:49,320
<i>- Crack on.
- Speak to you later.</i>

976
01:17:20,430 --> 01:17:23,890
- Right. Here you are. It's sweet.
- Other end of the bridge, lively.

977
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,370
Sweet, Bill?
Get down here all right?

978
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:47,710
30 years I've stood
toe to toe with you.

979
01:17:47,790 --> 01:17:49,710
You fuckin' mug me off like that?

980
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:50,800
Forget it.

981
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:25,250
Anyone who runs is gonna get
properly served up when we get home.

982
01:18:25,330 --> 01:18:27,000
You got it?

983
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:31,340
Are you all right, son, yeah?

984
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:33,050
Yeah. Are you?

985
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:38,260
I've got to tell you now.
I've got a really bad fuckin' feeling about this.

986
01:19:21,850 --> 01:19:23,890
<i>Come on! For fuck's sake.</i>

987
01:19:39,910 --> 01:19:42,450
Oi. Oi. Hold it here.
Hold it. Hold it.

988
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:51,130
Hold it.
Oi. Keep your fuckin' voices down.

989
01:19:51,210 --> 01:19:52,960
Keep your fuckin' voices down.

990
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,670
Keep it quiet. Keep it quiet.

991
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:11,900
Fuckin' wankers!

992
01:20:13,060 --> 01:20:14,770
Fuck.

993
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:25,490
Cunts!

994
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:26,830
You and your f...

995
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:41,510
<i>Clear the area.</i>

996
01:20:41,590 --> 01:20:43,430
<i>Immediately.</i>

997
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:48,310
Fuckin' cunt!

998
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:55,610
<i>Disperse, immediately.</i>

999
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:07,200
<i>I repeat: disperse now.</i>

1000
01:21:10,290 --> 01:21:12,330
<i>Clear the area.</i>

1001
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,630
Get him!

1002
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:23,300
Step on the cunt!

1003
01:21:23,380 --> 01:21:25,840
Get the cunt on the floor.
Get into him!

1004
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:35,440
Johnson! Johnson!
Leave my fuckin' brother in Casualty, you cunt?

1005
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,650
Get the fuck back!

1006
01:22:31,370 --> 01:22:33,000
Get out of the way!

1007
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:45,550
Leave it.

1008
01:23:20,670 --> 01:23:23,130
You nearly wound up in
the boneyard, my son.

1009
01:23:27,510 --> 01:23:29,090
How come you're here?

1010
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:31,220
They call it grieving.

1011
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:33,890
I call it falling fuckin' over.

1012
01:23:38,890 --> 01:23:41,560
Rod and the others was up.
Brought you some grapes.

1013
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:47,490
Was er... Zeberdee there?

1014
01:23:47,570 --> 01:23:50,240
Erm... young fella with black hair?

1015
01:23:51,370 --> 01:23:53,450
What, that little prick?
Yes, he was.

1016
01:23:55,700 --> 01:23:57,540
Thank fuck for that.

1017
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:05,000
What about Australia, Bill?

1018
01:24:05,090 --> 01:24:07,130
I'll fly next Tuesday.

1019
01:24:09,590 --> 01:24:11,220
What about you?

1020
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:14,760
What about me?

1021
01:24:15,810 --> 01:24:17,600
Huh!

1022
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:19,440
Was it worth it?

1023
01:24:32,910 --> 01:24:37,790
<i>Kicked half to death,
florists, cabbies, nightmares and visions.</i>

1024
01:24:37,870 --> 01:24:39,750
<i>One of the old soldiers
gone for ever.</i>

1025
01:24:39,830 --> 01:24:41,330
<i>Bright gone for a seven,</i>

1026
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:46,250
<i>and bollocks so ruptured that the only thing
I'll be pulling for months is a chain.</i>

1027
01:24:46,340 --> 01:24:50,380
<i>After all that you really do
have to ask yourself if it was a worth it.</i>

1028
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:56,470
<i>Course it fuckin' was.</i>

1029
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:08,190
Yeah, just get a pint over here.

1030
01:25:17,030 --> 01:25:20,410
They reckon, as soon as he got sentenced,
he started crying his eyes out.

1031
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:23,580
I'll do it standing on my head, you mug.
Fuck off.

1032
01:25:23,670 --> 01:25:28,840
You corrupt cunt. It's people like you
that are ruining this fuckin' country, you nonce.

1033
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:31,090
<i>- Take him down.
- Fuckin' mug.</i>

1034
01:25:31,170 --> 01:25:32,800
Here you are.

1035
01:25:34,090 --> 01:25:37,350
- Where are you going, you slippery cunt?
- Khazi. He gave me a livener.

1036
01:25:37,430 --> 01:25:40,600
Zeb, leave me some,
or you're fuckin' dead.

1037
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,670
What's happenin', Zeberfuckindee?
