1
00:01:47,034 --> 00:01:49,969
Hey, can I get another drink
down here?

2
00:01:50,037 --> 00:01:52,130
I've been to prison once.

3
00:01:52,206 --> 00:01:54,731
I've been married twice.

4
00:01:54,809 --> 00:01:57,073
I was once drafted by
Lyndon Johnson and had to live

5
00:01:57,144 --> 00:02:01,240
in shit-ass Mexico for two
and a half years for no reason.

6
00:02:01,315 --> 00:02:04,910
I've had my eye socket
punched in, a kidney taken out,

7
00:02:04,985 --> 00:02:08,546
and I got a bone chip in my
ankle that's never gonna heal.

8
00:02:09,256 --> 00:02:12,453
I've seen some pretty shitty
situations in my life.

9
00:02:12,526 --> 00:02:15,859
But nothing has ever sucked
more ass than this.

10
00:02:16,764 --> 00:02:19,426
If I'd known I was gonna have to
put up with screaming brats

11
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,468
pissing on my lap for 30 days
out of the year,

12
00:02:21,535 --> 00:02:25,164
I would have killed myself
a long time ago.

13
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:31,166
Come to think of it,
I still might.

14
00:02:32,546 --> 00:02:35,140
Where I come from,
we didn't celebrate Christmas.

15
00:02:35,216 --> 00:02:37,377
Not because we were Jewish,
but because my dad

16
00:02:37,451 --> 00:02:40,352
was a worthless-coward fucking
asshole whose idea of a present

17
00:02:40,421 --> 00:02:43,083
was a daily punch
to the back of the head.

18
00:02:43,157 --> 00:02:45,751
He did teach me
how to crack a safe, though.

19
00:02:47,161 --> 00:02:50,597
My dad never did shit with his
life, so he took it out on me.

20
00:02:50,664 --> 00:02:53,724
You could say I'm no different.
I'd have to say you were right.

21
00:02:53,801 --> 00:02:56,395
But at this point,
it's too late to start over.

22
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,461
Funny how things work out.

23
00:02:58,539 --> 00:03:00,837
It's fucking hilarious.

24
00:03:21,896 --> 00:03:24,262
There's Santa Claus.
Look there.

25
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:30,036
Wow.

26
00:03:35,309 --> 00:03:37,402
Oh, my.
What a darling photo.

27
00:03:37,478 --> 00:03:39,378
Are you certain you only want
the single?

28
00:03:39,447 --> 00:03:42,644
Additional photos come in handy
as gifts for Grandma and Grandpa

29
00:03:42,716 --> 00:03:45,082
or as a wonderful remembrance
for friends.

30
00:03:45,152 --> 00:03:46,176
Gee.
You know what?

31
00:03:46,253 --> 00:03:48,221
This one, I think it's more
than enough.

32
00:03:48,289 --> 00:03:51,122
Thanks.
Merry Christmas.

33
00:03:51,725 --> 00:03:53,659
So, what do you want,
little girl?

34
00:03:53,727 --> 00:03:55,524
A drum set.

35
00:03:55,596 --> 00:03:57,461
Oh, the old man will love that.

36
00:03:57,531 --> 00:03:59,761
Okay. Fine.
See you later.

37
00:04:08,976 --> 00:04:11,035
I saw you at another mall.

38
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:12,908
Well, I'm very happy for you.

39
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,811
You're not really Santa.

40
00:04:14,882 --> 00:04:17,180
If you were Santa,
you could do magic.

41
00:04:17,251 --> 00:04:19,276
You want to see some magic?

42
00:04:19,353 --> 00:04:21,685
Here.
Let's watch you disappear.

43
00:04:22,423 --> 00:04:24,823
Watch the bladder, kid.
Santa's got to pee.

44
00:04:24,892 --> 00:04:26,883
- What do you want?
- A new bike.

45
00:04:26,961 --> 00:04:28,929
Wow. That's a new one.
Excellent.

46
00:04:28,996 --> 00:04:30,293
Attention, shoppers.

47
00:04:30,364 --> 00:04:32,093
The store will be closing
in five minutes.

48
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:33,895
We hope tomorrow is
a pleasant Christmas.

49
00:04:33,968 --> 00:04:35,230
Thank you for shopping with us.

50
00:04:35,302 --> 00:04:37,862
- Is that it?
- Yeah, that's the last one.

51
00:04:37,938 --> 00:04:40,168
Thank the fuck Christ.

52
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,809
Jesus, Mother Mary, and Joseph.

53
00:04:42,877 --> 00:04:45,072
You pissed yourself.

54
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,441
Aw, Jesus.

55
00:04:53,487 --> 00:04:55,045
Yeah, all right.

56
00:04:55,122 --> 00:04:56,680
Yeah.

57
00:04:57,925 --> 00:05:00,985
Hey, happy holidays.
All right.

58
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:02,619
Merry Christmas.

59
00:05:03,163 --> 00:05:04,721
Happy holidays.

60
00:05:04,798 --> 00:05:05,992
Get home safe.

61
00:05:06,066 --> 00:05:07,693
Yeah, okay.

62
00:05:07,768 --> 00:05:09,065
I don't care what he says.

63
00:05:09,136 --> 00:05:11,297
- We're going out for a beer.
- What the fuck?

64
00:05:11,372 --> 00:05:13,431
I'll get right back to you.

65
00:05:13,507 --> 00:05:15,941
What the hell's wrong with you?
I'm trying to fucking leave.

66
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,341
Pants are awful baggy.

67
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:19,379
You got anything in there?

68
00:05:19,446 --> 00:05:22,176
Yeah. My dick.
You want to see it?

69
00:05:23,651 --> 00:05:25,585
Keep pushing me.

70
00:05:25,653 --> 00:05:27,518
I got my eyes on you.

71
00:05:27,588 --> 00:05:29,317
All the time.

72
00:06:32,553 --> 00:06:34,180
Ready.

73
00:06:38,258 --> 00:06:39,350
Jesus.

74
00:07:20,067 --> 00:07:22,365
- How's it going?
- I'm finished when I'm finished.

75
00:07:22,436 --> 00:07:23,698
I'm going back upstairs.

76
00:07:23,771 --> 00:07:25,602
I need a melon baller
and a loofah.

77
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:29,238
Got it.

78
00:07:32,513 --> 00:07:34,538
Fuck the loofah.
Let's go.

79
00:07:41,388 --> 00:07:43,379
Marcus, you get the loofah?

80
00:07:43,457 --> 00:07:45,015
Drive.

81
00:07:46,994 --> 00:07:48,427
Oh!

82
00:07:51,565 --> 00:07:54,659
<i>Jingle bell, jingle bell,
jingle bell rock</i>

83
00:07:54,735 --> 00:07:58,136
<i>Jingle bells chime
in jingle bell time</i>

84
00:07:58,205 --> 00:08:00,503
Oh, I'm dizzy.
Put me down.

85
00:08:00,574 --> 00:08:01,563
Hey, put me down.

86
00:08:01,642 --> 00:08:03,405
Come on!
Put me down.

87
00:08:04,545 --> 00:08:07,446
Oh, come on.

88
00:08:08,415 --> 00:08:10,542
Oh, man.

89
00:08:14,755 --> 00:08:16,746
Hey, baby, two more of these,
all right?

90
00:08:16,824 --> 00:08:18,917
No.
That's it for me.

91
00:08:19,493 --> 00:08:22,087
You can't drink worth a shit,
you know that?

92
00:08:23,964 --> 00:08:26,797
I weigh 92 pounds, you dick.

93
00:08:27,968 --> 00:08:30,732
Come on. One more.
It's a celebration.

94
00:08:32,506 --> 00:08:33,939
Here's to you.

95
00:08:34,007 --> 00:08:37,841
<i>To have the blues</i>

96
00:08:37,911 --> 00:08:41,870
<i>My baby's gone</i>

97
00:08:41,949 --> 00:08:44,611
You're getting worse,
you know that?

98
00:08:44,685 --> 00:08:46,778
Well, at least I got it open.

99
00:08:46,854 --> 00:08:48,788
It took you long enough.

100
00:08:48,856 --> 00:08:52,519
I remember when you could unlock
a lock like it was nothing.

101
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,688
Yeah, well, you don't have to
worry about me anymore.

102
00:08:57,798 --> 00:08:58,822
I'm out.

103
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:00,628
Bullshit.

104
00:09:01,668 --> 00:09:04,034
Bullshit, my ass.

105
00:09:04,671 --> 00:09:07,970
We just made $ 111,000
in one night.

106
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,703
Exactly. I figure I got enough
to go to Miami.

107
00:09:10,778 --> 00:09:12,211
And do what?

108
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:13,803
I don't know. Shit.
Get a car.

109
00:09:13,881 --> 00:09:16,441
Get a place, maybe.

110
00:09:16,517 --> 00:09:19,816
Maybe start a business.
A bar out on the beach.

111
00:09:19,887 --> 00:09:21,616
Something like that.

112
00:09:22,122 --> 00:09:26,456
I could quit drinking
and run the place.

113
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,722
Maybe marry a waitress.

114
00:09:31,565 --> 00:09:32,862
What?

115
00:09:32,933 --> 00:09:34,730
You ain't gonna do shit
except go down there

116
00:09:34,802 --> 00:09:36,599
and drink your fucking ass off.

117
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,399
You're gonna piss
everything away

118
00:09:38,472 --> 00:09:41,532
and end up counting the days
till next Christmas.

119
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:44,177
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

120
00:09:44,244 --> 00:09:45,768
Well, it ain't gonna happen.

121
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,548
If I call you next December...

122
00:09:48,615 --> 00:09:50,776
<i>if I call you next December...</i>

123
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:52,819
you're gonna be so happy
to hear from me

124
00:09:52,886 --> 00:09:55,116
you're gonna do
a goddamn backflip.

125
00:09:55,189 --> 00:09:57,453
You're gonna put
that Santa hat on so fast

126
00:09:57,524 --> 00:09:59,924
that you're gonna get
fucking hat-burn.

127
00:10:00,761 --> 00:10:02,820
Can I get you guys two more?

128
00:10:07,701 --> 00:10:09,794
No, thanks.
We're all right.

129
00:10:12,506 --> 00:10:14,235
See?

130
00:10:14,308 --> 00:10:16,674
I'm already on the wagon.

131
00:10:49,076 --> 00:10:50,270
Hey. Asshole!

132
00:10:50,344 --> 00:10:51,902
How many times
I got to tell you?

133
00:10:51,979 --> 00:10:53,810
Get out from behind my bar!

134
00:10:55,148 --> 00:10:57,048
Put the drink down right now.

135
00:10:57,117 --> 00:10:59,415
Put the drink down right now!

136
00:10:59,486 --> 00:11:01,147
Ahh.
Fuck you.

137
00:11:01,221 --> 00:11:02,654
- Fuck me, huh?
- Right.

138
00:11:02,723 --> 00:11:05,248
Oh. Hey!

139
00:11:05,826 --> 00:11:07,316
Ow!

140
00:11:07,394 --> 00:11:09,828
Get the fuck out of my bar.

141
00:11:12,432 --> 00:11:13,922
Fuck you!

142
00:11:14,001 --> 00:11:15,025
You're fucking crazy.

143
00:11:15,102 --> 00:11:16,831
Fucking prick.

144
00:11:17,571 --> 00:11:18,765
Asshole!

145
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:21,205
Get the fuck out of here
right now!

146
00:11:57,244 --> 00:11:59,542
<i>Have a holly
jolly Christmas</i>

147
00:11:59,613 --> 00:12:02,377
<i>And in case you didn't hear</i>

148
00:12:02,449 --> 00:12:05,976
<i>Oh, by golly,
have a holly jolly...</i>

149
00:12:06,053 --> 00:12:07,680
Fucking shit!

150
00:12:07,754 --> 00:12:13,087
Fuck you!

151
00:15:05,031 --> 00:15:06,965
Yeah, baby.

152
00:15:09,436 --> 00:15:12,599
Hey, Tiffany, you want to play
"Hide the Nazi" one day?

153
00:15:19,746 --> 00:15:21,577
God damn it.

154
00:15:24,151 --> 00:15:26,085
Here you go, sweetie.

155
00:15:27,554 --> 00:15:29,488
I got something
for your pretty ass.

156
00:15:29,556 --> 00:15:31,683
- You do?
- Yeah.

157
00:15:34,494 --> 00:15:36,894
Wow. $5.

158
00:15:36,963 --> 00:15:37,952
Thanks.

159
00:15:43,003 --> 00:15:46,404
I gotta listen to my messages,
and you need to take a shower.

160
00:15:47,073 --> 00:15:49,337
I'm a dancer.
I sweat.

161
00:15:49,409 --> 00:15:52,003
Yeah, well, you smell like
a bum's nut sac.

162
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:54,103
Fuck you.

163
00:15:58,084 --> 00:16:01,611
Message one.

164
00:16:01,688 --> 00:16:03,053
Mr. Soke?

165
00:16:03,123 --> 00:16:07,150
This is Andrew Kaplan again,
from the collection agency.

166
00:16:07,227 --> 00:16:09,695
Message two.

167
00:16:09,763 --> 00:16:11,754
This is Dolores Axelrod.

168
00:16:11,831 --> 00:16:13,856
You ran into my car last week.

169
00:16:13,934 --> 00:16:15,333
I called State Farm,

170
00:16:15,402 --> 00:16:18,803
but they have no record
of any insurance policy for you.

171
00:16:18,872 --> 00:16:21,500
In case you misplaced it,
my phone number is 4...

172
00:16:21,575 --> 00:16:23,475
Message three.

173
00:16:23,543 --> 00:16:26,876
Willie, it's Marcus.
It's that time of year again.

174
00:16:26,947 --> 00:16:30,110
Pack your shit.
Phoenix.

175
00:16:30,217 --> 00:16:33,744
<i>Oh, the weather outside
is frightful</i>

176
00:16:33,787 --> 00:16:37,314
<i>But the fire
is so delightful</i>

177
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:40,791
<i>And since we've no place
to go</i>

178
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,193
<i>Let it snow, let it snow,
let it snow</i>

179
00:16:44,264 --> 00:16:47,927
<i>Man, it doesn't show signs
of stopping</i>

180
00:16:48,001 --> 00:16:51,903
<i>And I brought me some corn
for popping</i>

181
00:16:51,972 --> 00:16:55,100
<i>The lights are turned
way down low</i>

182
00:16:55,175 --> 00:17:01,341
<i>Let it snow, let it snow</i>

183
00:17:06,019 --> 00:17:07,543
Jesus Christ!

184
00:17:07,621 --> 00:17:10,920
Can you maybe keep it together
for just 10 minutes?

185
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:20,522
Harrison, just let me explain,
please. Financially...

186
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,534
Well, you get what you paid for,
Chipeska.

187
00:17:22,602 --> 00:17:24,297
Five Christmases I've been here.

188
00:17:24,371 --> 00:17:26,464
You flip me for some stranger
who'll do it for peanuts

189
00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:29,064
and who happens to work
with a real midget.

190
00:17:29,142 --> 00:17:31,337
Nobody cares.
Nobody comes here for the elf.

191
00:17:31,411 --> 00:17:32,742
Santa's the attraction.

192
00:17:32,812 --> 00:17:34,279
I do Burl Ives songs.

193
00:17:34,347 --> 00:17:36,110
Does this schmo
even play guitar?

194
00:17:36,182 --> 00:17:39,640
Look, Harrison, it's not about
the money or the midget.

195
00:17:39,719 --> 00:17:41,482
Believe me, if it was, I...

196
00:17:41,554 --> 00:17:43,249
I don't think they like
"midget. "

197
00:17:43,323 --> 00:17:45,086
I think you're supposed to
call them...

198
00:17:45,158 --> 00:17:47,592
Oh, just forget it.

199
00:17:48,895 --> 00:17:50,624
Hacks!

200
00:17:51,164 --> 00:17:52,028
Hi.

201
00:17:52,098 --> 00:17:54,498
Bob Chipeska.
Welcome.

202
00:17:54,567 --> 00:17:56,558
Great photo and résumé,
by the way.

203
00:17:56,636 --> 00:17:57,398
Thanks.

204
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,563
We've been at this
a long time and all.

205
00:17:59,639 --> 00:18:01,402
We'd like to think we do
a good job.

206
00:18:01,474 --> 00:18:04,068
I'm so glad you guys could
come in on such short notice.

207
00:18:04,144 --> 00:18:06,704
I must say,
your look is just sensational.

208
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,439
Thanks.

209
00:18:07,514 --> 00:18:10,347
We've been at this for years.
You got nothing to worry about.

210
00:18:10,417 --> 00:18:13,284
You two are the best men
for this job, truly.

211
00:18:13,353 --> 00:18:16,686
So don't let his unpleasantness
affect your performance.

212
00:18:16,756 --> 00:18:18,724
- Oh, no. We're fine.
- Performance?

213
00:18:18,792 --> 00:18:21,693
Yes. Uh, your performance.
You know, the, um...

214
00:18:21,761 --> 00:18:23,956
Performance, like sexual?

215
00:18:25,131 --> 00:18:26,291
- Excuse me?
- Willie.

216
00:18:26,366 --> 00:18:28,698
Are you saying there's
something wrong with my gear?

217
00:18:28,768 --> 00:18:30,065
Is that what you're saying?

218
00:18:30,136 --> 00:18:31,603
- I'm sorry. Your gear?
- Willie.

219
00:18:31,671 --> 00:18:33,468
My fuck stick.

220
00:18:35,175 --> 00:18:37,006
Hey, Willie.
Take a seat.

221
00:18:37,077 --> 00:18:38,544
You know how
your blood sugar is.

222
00:18:38,611 --> 00:18:42,069
He's not going to say "fuck
stick" in front of the children?

223
00:18:42,148 --> 00:18:44,082
No, no, no.
It's a joke.

224
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:47,483
An adult joke for us adults.

225
00:18:47,554 --> 00:18:49,317
It's a joke.
Just a joke.

226
00:18:56,029 --> 00:18:56,996
"Fuck stick"?

227
00:18:57,063 --> 00:18:59,998
Yes. I thought it was
very strange, too.

228
00:19:00,066 --> 00:19:02,557
So, as our security chief,

229
00:19:02,635 --> 00:19:04,762
I wanted you to be aware.

230
00:19:04,838 --> 00:19:07,102
But his little friend promised
he wouldn't say it

231
00:19:07,173 --> 00:19:09,164
in front of the children,
which is fine.

232
00:19:09,242 --> 00:19:12,700
Because, you know,
there is an adult world

233
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:15,247
and a child's world,
and that's okay.

234
00:19:15,315 --> 00:19:17,078
I'm no censor.

235
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:17,912
"Little friend"?

236
00:19:17,984 --> 00:19:20,919
Yes, he happens to be a dwarf.

237
00:19:20,987 --> 00:19:23,615
Or midget.

238
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:26,056
I don't know
what he's called exactly.

239
00:19:26,126 --> 00:19:29,527
But, uh, he's a little guy.

240
00:19:29,596 --> 00:19:32,463
Little Billy Barty.
God rest.

241
00:19:32,532 --> 00:19:33,658
But thin fingers.

242
00:19:33,733 --> 00:19:38,227
Not the fat sausage fingers.

243
00:19:40,273 --> 00:19:42,207
"Little people. "
That's what they like.

244
00:19:42,275 --> 00:19:45,767
Yes. Uh, right.
Little people.

245
00:19:45,845 --> 00:19:47,836
So "fuck stick. "
That's it?

246
00:19:48,782 --> 00:19:50,647
Yeah.

247
00:19:55,688 --> 00:20:01,688
Merry Christmas!
Santa's coming. Yay!

248
00:20:01,761 --> 00:20:04,252
Merry Christmas!

249
00:20:09,369 --> 00:20:11,701
Have you seen that new Santa
they just hired?

250
00:20:11,771 --> 00:20:14,239
Yeah.
He's back there drunk.

251
00:20:18,278 --> 00:20:22,078
He's coming, guys.
Santa will be here real soon.

252
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,485
God damn it!

253
00:20:28,555 --> 00:20:31,581
What the fuck you doing?
You blow this, and we're broke.

254
00:20:31,658 --> 00:20:33,285
So stop acting
like you know something.

255
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:35,054
'Cause, pal of mine,
you don't know squat!

256
00:20:35,128 --> 00:20:37,028
Now, put on your hat
and get out there.

257
00:20:37,096 --> 00:20:40,224
And try to act professional,
for Christ's sakes.

258
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:47,568
What do you want?

259
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,164
What?

260
00:20:49,242 --> 00:20:50,800
Get out of here.

261
00:20:50,877 --> 00:20:52,606
Next.

262
00:20:53,446 --> 00:20:55,277
Next.

263
00:20:55,348 --> 00:20:57,782
Oh, good.
What do you want?

264
00:20:59,152 --> 00:21:01,052
What do you want?
What are you doing?

265
00:21:03,256 --> 00:21:04,245
God damn it!

266
00:21:04,324 --> 00:21:06,485
Nintendo Deer Hunter 3.

267
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,527
I don't give a shit
what you want.

268
00:21:08,595 --> 00:21:11,257
Blowing snot all over everybody
and fucking whatever.

269
00:21:11,331 --> 00:21:13,356
Next.
Come on.

270
00:21:15,301 --> 00:21:16,859
What do you want?

271
00:21:16,936 --> 00:21:19,200
- Um, Santa?
- Yeah, I'm Santa.

272
00:21:19,272 --> 00:21:20,466
Come on.
What do you want?

273
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,701
- Um, Barbie.
- Say cheese.

274
00:21:22,775 --> 00:21:23,969
Okay. Fine.
Barbie.

275
00:21:24,043 --> 00:21:25,305
Oh, thank you.

276
00:21:25,378 --> 00:21:28,347
Ow! Watch the toenails, kid!
Shit.

277
00:21:28,414 --> 00:21:29,711
Next.

278
00:21:30,817 --> 00:21:32,751
Next!

279
00:21:35,188 --> 00:21:36,280
What do you want?

280
00:21:36,356 --> 00:21:38,881
Fraggle-Stick car.

281
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,949
What the fuck is that?

282
00:21:41,027 --> 00:21:42,585
Fraggle-Stick car.

283
00:21:42,662 --> 00:21:45,631
Well, I heard you.
Fraggle-Stick car. Fine.

284
00:22:00,413 --> 00:22:02,506
Hey, check out this loser.

285
00:22:03,082 --> 00:22:05,448
Hey, fat-ass.
How you doing today?

286
00:22:07,554 --> 00:22:09,112
Hey, loser.

287
00:22:09,188 --> 00:22:11,019
Hey, dipshit.

288
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:12,648
Moron.

289
00:22:13,192 --> 00:22:15,592
Hey, loser.
How you doing today?

290
00:22:16,396 --> 00:22:18,728
Dumb-ass,
why don't you turn around?

291
00:22:21,868 --> 00:22:24,336
You know what?
Fuck this.

292
00:22:29,042 --> 00:22:30,600
You're next.

293
00:22:30,677 --> 00:22:32,668
Next.

294
00:22:32,745 --> 00:22:36,112
I said next, God damn it.
This is not the DMV, all right?

295
00:22:36,182 --> 00:22:37,877
Move it along.

296
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,319
What's your name?
You can tell me.

297
00:22:44,424 --> 00:22:46,688
I know.
How about Santa?

298
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:49,319
If you don't tell him,
you won't get a present.

299
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,454
That's right.

300
00:22:51,531 --> 00:22:54,500
Come on and tell Santa
all about it.

301
00:22:58,137 --> 00:22:59,126
What do you want?

302
00:23:01,374 --> 00:23:02,966
Well, come on.
What do you want?

303
00:23:03,042 --> 00:23:04,907
A snot-rag?

304
00:23:07,914 --> 00:23:10,075
Great.
Another fucking Mongoloid.

305
00:23:10,149 --> 00:23:13,482
Marcus, get this kid off me
before he pisses on me.

306
00:23:13,553 --> 00:23:15,214
Don't fuck with my beard.

307
00:23:15,288 --> 00:23:16,755
It's not real.

308
00:23:16,823 --> 00:23:18,313
No shit.

309
00:23:18,391 --> 00:23:19,619
Well, it was real.

310
00:23:19,692 --> 00:23:23,025
But, you see, I got sick
and all the hair fell out.

311
00:23:23,096 --> 00:23:25,030
How did you get sick?

312
00:23:25,632 --> 00:23:27,566
I loved a woman
who wasn't clean.

313
00:23:27,634 --> 00:23:28,726
Mrs. Santa?

314
00:23:28,801 --> 00:23:30,029
No.
It was her sister.

315
00:23:30,103 --> 00:23:32,230
What's it like
at the North Pole?

316
00:23:32,305 --> 00:23:33,670
Like the suburbs.

317
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,230
Which one?

318
00:23:36,142 --> 00:23:37,439
Apache Junction.

319
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:40,274
What the fuck do you care?
Now, get off my lap.

320
00:23:40,346 --> 00:23:42,337
You sit there
like a fucking retard.

321
00:23:42,415 --> 00:23:44,383
You are really Santa, right?

322
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:45,781
No.
I'm an accountant.

323
00:23:45,852 --> 00:23:49,310
I wear this fucking thing as
a fashion statement, all right?

324
00:23:49,389 --> 00:23:51,118
Okay.

325
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:53,715
Get this kid out of here.
He's freaking me out.

326
00:23:59,499 --> 00:24:02,832
I got to get a drink on.
I'll see you tomorrow.

327
00:24:02,902 --> 00:24:05,598
Just don't come into work
stinking of booze again.

328
00:24:05,672 --> 00:24:07,139
Yeah.
Why don't you get going?

329
00:24:07,206 --> 00:24:10,198
You'll be late for your
"Wizard of Oz" Candy Bar Guild.

330
00:24:10,276 --> 00:24:12,676
Lollipop Guild, you asshole.
Jesus!

331
00:24:12,745 --> 00:24:15,145
Two-year-olds flip me shit
better than you.

332
00:24:15,214 --> 00:24:16,306
You saying something to me?

333
00:24:16,382 --> 00:24:19,715
Yeah. I'm gonna stick
my whole fist up your ass.

334
00:24:27,994 --> 00:24:30,588
<i>Jingle bells, jingle bells</i>

335
00:24:30,663 --> 00:24:32,824
<i>Jingle all the way</i>

336
00:24:32,899 --> 00:24:37,063
<i>Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh</i>

337
00:24:37,136 --> 00:24:39,661
<i>Jingle bells, jingle bells</i>

338
00:24:39,739 --> 00:24:41,764
<i>Jingle all the way</i>

339
00:24:41,841 --> 00:24:46,107
<i>Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh</i>

340
00:24:46,179 --> 00:24:50,741
<i>Dashing through the snow
in a one-horse open sleigh</i>

341
00:24:50,817 --> 00:24:55,277
<i>O'er the fields we go,
laughing all the way</i>

342
00:24:55,354 --> 00:24:57,914
<i>Bells on bobtail ring,
making spirits bright</i>

343
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,423
What?

344
00:24:59,492 --> 00:25:04,122
<i>What fun it is to ride and
sing a sleighing song tonight</i>

345
00:25:04,197 --> 00:25:07,030
<i>Jingle bells, jingle bells</i>

346
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,032
Mmm.

347
00:25:08,101 --> 00:25:11,161
Another Grand-Dad, Santa?

348
00:25:11,237 --> 00:25:12,169
Yeah.

349
00:25:12,238 --> 00:25:13,330
Yeah?

350
00:25:13,406 --> 00:25:15,601
<i>Jingle bells, jingle bells</i>

351
00:25:15,675 --> 00:25:17,734
<i>Jingle all the way</i>

352
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:19,368
<i>Oh, what fun it is to ride</i>

353
00:25:19,445 --> 00:25:21,072
Got a name?

354
00:25:23,049 --> 00:25:24,778
Yeah.

355
00:25:26,619 --> 00:25:29,383
So, what do you do, you know...

356
00:25:29,455 --> 00:25:30,888
After the holidays, I mean.

357
00:25:30,957 --> 00:25:33,892
Well, nothing till March,
and then I'm the Easter Bunny.

358
00:25:38,731 --> 00:25:39,891
Oh. Another?

359
00:25:39,966 --> 00:25:41,399
Yeah. Why not?

360
00:25:45,138 --> 00:25:46,537
Merry Christmas.

361
00:25:50,576 --> 00:25:52,669
Not a big talker.

362
00:25:52,745 --> 00:25:54,303
No, not really.

363
00:25:57,049 --> 00:25:58,710
- Buy you one?
- Why not?

364
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:06,151
Happy New Year.

365
00:26:09,295 --> 00:26:11,786
You're pretty regular
for a Santa.

366
00:26:11,864 --> 00:26:13,525
It's not that big
a fucking deal.

367
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:15,794
It's just a job,
you know what I mean?

368
00:26:15,868 --> 00:26:20,237
I'm an eating, drinking,
shitting, fucking Santy Claus.

369
00:26:21,941 --> 00:26:23,306
Prove it.

370
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:27,541
Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa.

371
00:26:27,613 --> 00:26:30,741
Fuck me, Santa. Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa. Fuck me, Santa.

372
00:26:30,817 --> 00:26:32,375
Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa!

373
00:26:32,451 --> 00:26:33,816
Can't I at least take
this hat off?

374
00:26:33,886 --> 00:26:35,581
No. I love the hat.

375
00:26:35,655 --> 00:26:37,452
Okay.

376
00:26:37,523 --> 00:26:40,686
Whoo!

377
00:26:44,797 --> 00:26:49,029
I've always had a thing
for Santa Claus.

378
00:26:49,101 --> 00:26:50,728
In case you didn't notice.

379
00:26:50,803 --> 00:26:53,795
It's like some deep-seated
childhood thing.

380
00:26:53,873 --> 00:26:55,807
So is my thing for tits.

381
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:58,139
Yeah.
It is like that, though.

382
00:26:58,211 --> 00:26:59,405
From when you're a kid.

383
00:26:59,478 --> 00:27:01,810
'Cause my dad was Jewish,
and we didn't have Christmas.

384
00:27:01,881 --> 00:27:06,375
So it was like
this forbidden thing.

385
00:27:09,455 --> 00:27:11,116
So...

386
00:27:13,826 --> 00:27:15,123
I like you.

387
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:19,528
Don't mothball that suit.

388
00:27:26,272 --> 00:27:27,204
What the fuck?

389
00:27:27,273 --> 00:27:29,264
I am not gay.

390
00:27:30,243 --> 00:27:32,268
- What the hell, buddy?
- Buddy?

391
00:27:32,345 --> 00:27:34,245
I said I am not gay.

392
00:27:34,313 --> 00:27:37,441
Are you off your fucking meds
or something?

393
00:27:37,516 --> 00:27:38,983
Yes.

394
00:27:39,051 --> 00:27:41,713
But that isn't
what this is about.

395
00:27:41,787 --> 00:27:43,482
You're as queer as a $ 10 bill.

396
00:27:43,556 --> 00:27:45,888
Let me tell you something,
motherfucker.

397
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:49,655
My brother lost a goddamn arm
fighting you fuckers in Vietnam.

398
00:27:49,729 --> 00:27:52,926
So I want you to look at my face
one last fucking time.

399
00:27:52,999 --> 00:27:55,627
This is the last thing you're
ever gonna see before I...

400
00:27:55,701 --> 00:27:56,668
Elf fucker!

401
00:27:56,736 --> 00:27:58,829
- Motherfucker!
- Turn around, elf fucker.

402
00:27:58,905 --> 00:28:01,373
Who's the bitch now,
Santy Claus? Huh?

403
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,169
Faggy Claus!
Faggy!

404
00:28:03,242 --> 00:28:04,504
Leave Santa alone!

405
00:28:04,577 --> 00:28:07,876
Little boy, don't interfere.
I am doing this for all of us.

406
00:28:07,947 --> 00:28:09,710
Leave Santa alone!

407
00:28:13,853 --> 00:28:16,185
Ass clown.

408
00:28:23,296 --> 00:28:25,230
Hey, you're that kid.

409
00:28:26,966 --> 00:28:29,025
What the fuck are you
doing here?

410
00:28:42,148 --> 00:28:44,412
This one fucking time
I take you home, okay?

411
00:28:44,483 --> 00:28:45,472
Uh-huh.

412
00:28:45,551 --> 00:28:46,984
I'm not your fucking dada.

413
00:28:47,053 --> 00:28:48,748
Uh-huh.

414
00:28:50,423 --> 00:28:53,358
It's not like you helped me
with that nutjob or anything.

415
00:28:53,426 --> 00:28:55,087
- Uh-huh.
- You're the right height.

416
00:28:55,161 --> 00:28:57,755
You're right there
to grab his balls.

417
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:00,025
- You could twist them.
- Why do you need a car?

418
00:29:00,099 --> 00:29:03,159
- What?
- This car.

419
00:29:03,235 --> 00:29:04,167
Which turn is it?

420
00:29:04,236 --> 00:29:06,329
Sage Terrace.
Where's your sleigh?

421
00:29:06,405 --> 00:29:08,566
It's in the shop,
getting repaired.

422
00:29:08,641 --> 00:29:11,075
- Where are the reindeer?
- I stabled them.

423
00:29:11,143 --> 00:29:12,405
Is it left or right?

424
00:29:12,478 --> 00:29:13,502
That way.

425
00:29:13,579 --> 00:29:15,206
Where's the stable?

426
00:29:15,281 --> 00:29:17,442
- Next to the shop.
- How do they sleep?

427
00:29:17,516 --> 00:29:19,609
Who? The reindeer?
Standing up.

428
00:29:19,685 --> 00:29:21,152
But the noise.
How do they sleep?

429
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,211
- What noise?
- From the shop.

430
00:29:24,657 --> 00:29:26,750
They only work during the day,
all right?

431
00:29:26,826 --> 00:29:28,589
I thought it was always night
at the North Pole.

432
00:29:28,661 --> 00:29:30,595
Well, not now.
Right now it's always day.

433
00:29:30,663 --> 00:29:31,857
Then how do they sleep?

434
00:29:31,931 --> 00:29:34,229
Oh, shit. Sage Terrace.

435
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,758
What is it with you? Somebody
drop you on your fucking head?

436
00:29:37,837 --> 00:29:39,236
<i>On my head?</i>

437
00:29:39,305 --> 00:29:41,569
Are they gonna drop you
on somebody else's head?

438
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,301
How can they drop me
onto my own head?

439
00:29:43,376 --> 00:29:46,140
<i>No, not onto your...
Would...</i>

440
00:29:46,212 --> 00:29:49,272
God damn it!
Are you fucking with me?

441
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:55,253
Okay.
Which house is it?

442
00:29:55,321 --> 00:29:56,583
That one.

443
00:29:56,655 --> 00:29:58,520
With Jesus and his family
there or what?

444
00:29:58,591 --> 00:30:00,149
No.
The one beside that.

445
00:30:00,226 --> 00:30:02,057
- Right here?
- Yeah. That one.

446
00:30:02,128 --> 00:30:03,618
All right.

447
00:30:11,804 --> 00:30:13,772
Nice digs.

448
00:30:15,074 --> 00:30:16,507
Is Daddy home?

449
00:30:16,575 --> 00:30:18,543
He's on an adventure,
exploring mountains.

450
00:30:18,611 --> 00:30:20,044
He's been gone a long time.

451
00:30:20,112 --> 00:30:23,843
Exploring mountains, huh?
How long is he gonna be gone?

452
00:30:23,916 --> 00:30:24,848
Till next year.

453
00:30:24,917 --> 00:30:26,214
Yeah?
What about Mommy?

454
00:30:26,285 --> 00:30:29,379
She lives in God's house with
Jesus and Mary and the ghost

455
00:30:29,455 --> 00:30:32,947
and the long-eared donkey and
Joseph and the talking walnut.

456
00:30:33,692 --> 00:30:35,489
Well, who the fuck takes care
of you, then?

457
00:30:35,561 --> 00:30:36,357
Grandma.

458
00:30:36,429 --> 00:30:38,021
Yeah?
What's her name?

459
00:30:38,097 --> 00:30:39,428
Grandma.

460
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:42,499
Is Granny spry?

461
00:30:46,672 --> 00:30:47,661
Everybody!

462
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:50,208
<i>D- O-L-E, Dole</i>

463
00:30:50,276 --> 00:30:51,402
<i>Banana shuffle</i>

464
00:30:51,477 --> 00:30:54,469
Grandma? Grandma?

465
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,777
Santa's here.

466
00:30:56,849 --> 00:30:59,977
Oh, Roger.
You're home.

467
00:31:00,052 --> 00:31:02,316
Are you spry?

468
00:31:02,388 --> 00:31:05,653
Let me fix you some sandwiches.

469
00:31:13,065 --> 00:31:16,557
Are you telling me
she's the only one here?

470
00:31:16,635 --> 00:31:18,000
Nobody else?

471
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:21,164
No aunts or cousins or uncles
or anything like that?

472
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,208
A butler or security guard
or something?

473
00:31:23,275 --> 00:31:25,607
Nuh-unh.

474
00:31:25,678 --> 00:31:27,612
You're shitting me.

475
00:31:29,748 --> 00:31:31,875
Does your daddy have a safe?

476
00:31:37,857 --> 00:31:39,688
Need money to fix your sleigh?

477
00:31:39,758 --> 00:31:41,692
Exactly.

478
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:48,430
You want milk and cookies?

479
00:31:48,501 --> 00:31:49,559
No.

480
00:31:49,635 --> 00:31:51,159
Should I fix you
some sandwiches?

481
00:31:51,237 --> 00:31:52,534
Unh-unh.

482
00:31:52,605 --> 00:31:54,072
Does your daddy have a car?

483
00:31:58,878 --> 00:32:01,244
Bye, Santa!

484
00:32:03,349 --> 00:32:06,682
<i>First comes the stocking
of little Nell</i>

485
00:32:06,752 --> 00:32:10,017
<i>Dear old Santa,
fill it well</i>

486
00:32:13,292 --> 00:32:14,554
Oh, my!

487
00:32:17,663 --> 00:32:19,563
Keep going.
- Jesus!

488
00:32:19,632 --> 00:32:20,929
Ohh!

489
00:32:22,201 --> 00:32:25,102
Oh, God!

490
00:32:25,171 --> 00:32:26,103
Ooh!

491
00:32:26,172 --> 00:32:28,936
Oh, Zena!
Oh, Mary!

492
00:32:29,008 --> 00:32:30,066
Keep it going.

493
00:32:30,142 --> 00:32:31,871
Jesus Christ!

494
00:32:31,944 --> 00:32:33,639
Yeah, baby.
Yeah, baby.

495
00:32:33,712 --> 00:32:36,237
You ain't gonna
shit right for a week.

496
00:32:36,315 --> 00:32:37,247
Oh!

497
00:32:37,316 --> 00:32:38,749
- Yeah, buddy!
- Yeah!

498
00:32:38,817 --> 00:32:41,149
Whoo!

499
00:32:44,623 --> 00:32:46,784
It won't happen again.
I can promise you that.

500
00:32:46,859 --> 00:32:50,090
Willie here has low blood sugar.
That's all.

501
00:32:50,162 --> 00:32:52,357
That's right.
I forgot to take my pill.

502
00:32:53,032 --> 00:32:55,830
It's not just the swearing.

503
00:32:55,901 --> 00:32:57,425
Um...

504
00:32:58,003 --> 00:33:00,437
Forgive me for prying.

505
00:33:00,506 --> 00:33:04,101
But did one of you, um...

506
00:33:04,176 --> 00:33:05,268
fornicate...

507
00:33:05,344 --> 00:33:06,311
Fornicate?

508
00:33:06,378 --> 00:33:10,075
Yes, with a heavyset woman
in the Big & Tall dressing room.

509
00:33:10,149 --> 00:33:12,617
Look, I've boned a lot
of fat chicks in my time, sure.

510
00:33:12,685 --> 00:33:17,816
But as far as I can recall,
I've never fornicated anybody.

511
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:19,084
Yes, well, even still,

512
00:33:19,158 --> 00:33:22,093
I think it's best for
all parties considered if we...

513
00:33:22,161 --> 00:33:23,822
If we what?

514
00:33:24,396 --> 00:33:27,490
Well, I have someone else
interested in the position.

515
00:33:28,434 --> 00:33:29,958
Before you do something stupid,

516
00:33:30,035 --> 00:33:31,593
you may want to think
about this shit.

517
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:32,830
What are you talking about?

518
00:33:32,905 --> 00:33:35,499
I'm talking about firing
a little black midget.

519
00:33:35,574 --> 00:33:38,134
A colored, African-American
small person.

520
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:39,438
That's what I'm talking about.

521
00:33:39,511 --> 00:33:43,607
I'm talking about your face
all over goddamn "USA Today. "

522
00:33:43,682 --> 00:33:46,082
I'm talking about 150
of these little motherfuckers

523
00:33:46,151 --> 00:33:48,278
all over the sidewalk out there.

524
00:33:48,354 --> 00:33:50,254
Little picket signs,
chanting and raving.

525
00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:52,688
Using little bullhorns
and shit like that.

526
00:33:52,758 --> 00:33:55,352
Screaming and hollering
your name out.

527
00:33:55,427 --> 00:33:57,622
Unfair practices.
Get me?

528
00:33:57,696 --> 00:33:59,994
No. No, no.
This is not a handicap thing.

529
00:34:00,065 --> 00:34:02,329
I have nothing
against you people.

530
00:34:03,869 --> 00:34:05,234
"You people"?

531
00:34:05,304 --> 00:34:08,102
Did you hear that, Marcus?
He said, "You people. "

532
00:34:08,173 --> 00:34:09,470
Who the hell is "us people"?

533
00:34:09,541 --> 00:34:10,803
Wait. Wait.
No, no.

534
00:34:10,876 --> 00:34:13,106
I... You don't under...
What?

535
00:34:13,178 --> 00:34:15,169
He...
No, no.

536
00:34:15,247 --> 00:34:18,182
Um, you know, I think it's best

537
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:21,117
if we just forget we had
this conversation.

538
00:34:22,921 --> 00:34:24,582
Okay.

539
00:34:24,657 --> 00:34:25,919
Good thinking.

540
00:34:25,991 --> 00:34:28,482
And don't worry about us.
We'll be fine.

541
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,994
Let's get the hell
out of here, Marcus.

542
00:34:36,068 --> 00:34:37,296
You're pathetic.

543
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,339
I dig that little thing
on your belly button.

544
00:34:50,416 --> 00:34:51,678
What's that?
Like a diamond?

545
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:53,718
It's a belly-button ring.

546
00:34:53,786 --> 00:34:55,185
Oh, yeah?
Hang on a second.

547
00:34:55,254 --> 00:34:56,915
Check this out.

548
00:34:56,989 --> 00:34:59,719
You got to thrust.
See what I'm saying?

549
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:03,390
You gotta move the ball around.
You go up there, baby.

550
00:35:03,462 --> 00:35:04,793
Come on.

551
00:35:04,863 --> 00:35:07,127
See? Move the ball.
There you go.

552
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:09,429
Motherfucker!

553
00:35:09,501 --> 00:35:12,698
Oh, you lousy, fucking
motherfucker.

554
00:35:16,108 --> 00:35:18,042
That's the shit
that's gonna get us pinched.

555
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,441
She said she was 18.

556
00:35:19,511 --> 00:35:20,910
But you promised no arcades.

557
00:35:20,979 --> 00:35:22,708
You said you'd only hustle
Big & Tall.

558
00:35:22,781 --> 00:35:25,579
You shat me out of your womb?
You're my fucking mom now?

559
00:35:25,651 --> 00:35:27,312
I don't need
any goddamn lectures.

560
00:35:27,386 --> 00:35:29,854
I know how to keep
a low profile. Thank you.

561
00:35:31,056 --> 00:35:33,786
What the fuck is this,
Mr. Low Profile?

562
00:35:33,859 --> 00:35:36,123
Mind your own goddamn business.

563
00:35:43,836 --> 00:35:45,770
Ever hear of
the open bottle law?

564
00:35:47,973 --> 00:35:53,036
A couple of days ago, I was in,
uh, Women's Big & Tall.

565
00:35:53,112 --> 00:35:55,171
And I heard these...

566
00:35:55,247 --> 00:35:59,343
Um, you know, these noises.

567
00:35:59,418 --> 00:36:03,946
And I heard a woman screaming,
"Yeah. Oh, yeah. "

568
00:36:04,022 --> 00:36:07,355
And I heard his voice saying,
"That's right.

569
00:36:07,426 --> 00:36:13,422
You ain't going to S-H-I-T
right for a month. "

570
00:36:14,733 --> 00:36:16,200
But don't get me wrong.

571
00:36:16,268 --> 00:36:19,362
I was against
the Clinton impeachment.

572
00:36:19,438 --> 00:36:21,429
What a man does
with his own penis...

573
00:36:21,507 --> 00:36:23,600
Oval Office,
Women's Big & Tall...

574
00:36:23,675 --> 00:36:26,371
it's not for
the American people to say.

575
00:36:26,445 --> 00:36:27,173
Yeah, right.

576
00:36:27,246 --> 00:36:30,773
But when you're dealing
with children...

577
00:36:34,019 --> 00:36:36,453
They have a tender sensibility.

578
00:36:36,522 --> 00:36:38,387
And you are in a position
of trust.

579
00:36:38,457 --> 00:36:44,020
I think perhaps someone who has
screaming orgasms

580
00:36:44,096 --> 00:36:46,724
with large women shouldn't...

581
00:36:46,799 --> 00:36:48,289
Yeah.

582
00:36:49,601 --> 00:36:51,330
Of course,
I can't fire him for that.

583
00:36:51,403 --> 00:36:53,633
Oh, yeah.
Unfair practices.

584
00:36:53,705 --> 00:36:56,265
Special pleading.
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

585
00:36:56,341 --> 00:36:57,706
Fucking broads.

586
00:36:57,776 --> 00:36:59,038
But I just can't help it.

587
00:36:59,111 --> 00:37:02,569
There's something about the guy
that makes me uneasy.

588
00:37:02,648 --> 00:37:03,615
Well, sure.

589
00:37:03,682 --> 00:37:06,378
Santa fucking someone
in the ass.

590
00:37:08,554 --> 00:37:10,613
So...

591
00:37:10,689 --> 00:37:13,249
Maybe there's something
I could fire him for.

592
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,492
Yeah, I get you.

593
00:37:15,561 --> 00:37:17,222
Do you?

594
00:37:17,296 --> 00:37:19,161
Do you think
you could find something?

595
00:37:19,231 --> 00:37:22,200
Shit, yeah.
There's always something.

596
00:37:47,459 --> 00:37:48,448
Shit.

597
00:37:49,661 --> 00:37:52,129
Hey, Opal.
Come here.

598
00:37:52,197 --> 00:37:53,391
Unh-unh.

599
00:37:53,465 --> 00:37:55,296
Screw you, Willie,
your kinky ass.

600
00:37:55,367 --> 00:37:57,232
Last time I didn't shit right
for a week.

601
00:37:57,302 --> 00:38:00,328
No, it's not that.
I need to talk to you.

602
00:38:00,405 --> 00:38:03,374
I'm just tired of you, Willie.

603
00:38:04,309 --> 00:38:05,435
Ooh.

604
00:38:07,813 --> 00:38:09,747
Who the fuck is in my room?

605
00:38:09,815 --> 00:38:11,282
Did you see somebody
go in my room?

606
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:13,477
Yeah.
Some guy asking about you.

607
00:38:13,552 --> 00:38:14,712
Looked like a cop.

608
00:38:14,786 --> 00:38:16,378
Oh, shit.

609
00:38:17,689 --> 00:38:18,815
Marcus, it's Willie.

610
00:38:18,891 --> 00:38:20,984
I just got back to the motel.

611
00:38:21,059 --> 00:38:23,391
Some guy is nosing around
in my room.

612
00:38:23,462 --> 00:38:25,089
What guy?
You get a look at him?

613
00:38:25,163 --> 00:38:26,790
No.
But I think he's a cop, though.

614
00:38:26,865 --> 00:38:27,991
Think somebody's onto us?

615
00:38:28,066 --> 00:38:30,330
Is there anything in the room?
Anything professional?

616
00:38:30,402 --> 00:38:31,835
No, I just got clothes in there.

617
00:38:31,904 --> 00:38:33,235
Just ditch, you idiot.

618
00:38:33,305 --> 00:38:35,398
You got anywhere to sack out
for a while?

619
00:38:36,408 --> 00:38:38,171
- Santa!
- Yeah.

620
00:38:38,243 --> 00:38:39,835
You're bringing
my present early?

621
00:38:39,912 --> 00:38:41,243
No.

622
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,980
But I never told you
what I wanted.

623
00:38:44,049 --> 00:38:46,882
I said I didn't bring it,
dipshit.

624
00:38:46,952 --> 00:38:48,419
Okay. Good.

625
00:38:48,487 --> 00:38:51,513
I want a stuffed elephant.
A pink one.

626
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,581
Wish in one hand,
shit in the other one.

627
00:38:53,659 --> 00:38:56,492
See which one fills up first.

628
00:38:56,562 --> 00:38:57,995
Okay.

629
00:38:58,063 --> 00:39:00,258
So I'm gonna be staying here
for a while.

630
00:39:00,332 --> 00:39:02,357
Things are all fucked up
at the North Pole.

631
00:39:02,434 --> 00:39:04,459
Mrs. Santa caught me
fucking her sister.

632
00:39:04,536 --> 00:39:07,369
And I'm out on my ass now.

633
00:39:07,439 --> 00:39:09,304
She got half of everything.

634
00:39:09,374 --> 00:39:11,365
This is gonna be cool.

635
00:39:11,443 --> 00:39:13,274
This will do fine.

636
00:39:19,418 --> 00:39:21,409
So I'm gonna be crashing here.

637
00:39:21,486 --> 00:39:24,683
It will be just you and me,
like roommates, you know?

638
00:39:24,756 --> 00:39:26,917
Do you and Mrs. Santa have kids?

639
00:39:26,992 --> 00:39:28,619
No.
Thank the fuck Christ.

640
00:39:28,694 --> 00:39:30,662
What about the elves?

641
00:39:31,096 --> 00:39:33,690
Well, they stay with Mrs. Santa.

642
00:39:34,266 --> 00:39:35,995
I get them on the weekends.

643
00:39:36,068 --> 00:39:38,263
Why don't you go run me a bath?

644
00:39:42,107 --> 00:39:43,506
What about the reindeer?

645
00:39:43,575 --> 00:39:46,135
Would you please shut up
about reindeer?

646
00:39:47,713 --> 00:39:49,146
What are their names?

647
00:39:49,214 --> 00:39:50,203
Who?

648
00:39:50,282 --> 00:39:51,340
The elves.

649
00:39:51,416 --> 00:39:52,781
Oh, shit.
I can't remember.

650
00:39:52,851 --> 00:39:55,217
I think one of them is Sneezy.
There's a Dopey.

651
00:39:55,287 --> 00:39:57,187
That's the Seven Dwarfs.

652
00:39:57,255 --> 00:39:58,984
Oh, you're shitting me.

653
00:39:59,057 --> 00:40:02,151
I thought...
I was thinking it was the...

654
00:40:02,227 --> 00:40:03,489
I don't know.
Fuck, kid.

655
00:40:03,562 --> 00:40:05,655
I just call them, "bub. "

656
00:40:05,731 --> 00:40:07,790
I say, "Hey, bub" or "chief"
or whatever the fuck.

657
00:40:07,866 --> 00:40:09,629
I tell him to make
the goddamn toy.

658
00:40:09,701 --> 00:40:11,669
What the fuck is wrong
with you?

659
00:40:11,737 --> 00:40:13,500
I can't remember this shit!

660
00:40:13,572 --> 00:40:16,598
Does everything with you
have to be a fucking test?

661
00:40:19,211 --> 00:40:20,610
How old are they?

662
00:40:26,118 --> 00:40:27,676
You want cookies?

663
00:40:28,587 --> 00:40:29,576
No.

664
00:40:29,655 --> 00:40:30,883
Warm milk?

665
00:40:30,956 --> 00:40:31,854
No.

666
00:40:31,923 --> 00:40:33,618
Should I fix you
some sandwiches?

667
00:40:33,692 --> 00:40:35,455
I don't want
any fucking sandwiches.

668
00:40:35,527 --> 00:40:38,018
What is it with you
and fixing fucking sandwiches?

669
00:40:38,096 --> 00:40:40,394
Okay.
Do you want anything else?

670
00:40:40,465 --> 00:40:42,092
No.

671
00:40:44,169 --> 00:40:45,636
Okay.

672
00:40:54,112 --> 00:40:55,977
Santa?

673
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:02,347
What?

674
00:41:02,421 --> 00:41:04,981
I brought you some orange juice.

675
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,152
What's in it?

676
00:41:09,227 --> 00:41:10,819
Oranges.

677
00:41:13,598 --> 00:41:15,429
Look what I have.

678
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,559
An Advent calendar.

679
00:41:17,636 --> 00:41:18,762
What the hell is that?

680
00:41:18,837 --> 00:41:22,603
It's the story of Christmas,
but in a calendar.

681
00:41:22,674 --> 00:41:24,699
Every day you peel open
a new box.

682
00:41:24,776 --> 00:41:26,368
You get part of the story.

683
00:41:26,445 --> 00:41:28,436
And then there's
a chocolate inside.

684
00:41:28,513 --> 00:41:31,141
Do you want to open up
today's box and read it?

685
00:41:32,117 --> 00:41:34,051
No.
You go ahead.

686
00:41:36,021 --> 00:41:39,422
Jesus Christ, kid.
Watch the nuts.

687
00:41:46,998 --> 00:41:50,627
"So Joseph went up from
the town of Nazareth in Galilee

688
00:41:50,702 --> 00:41:53,694
to Judea, to Bethlehem,
the town of David.

689
00:41:53,772 --> 00:41:56,707
In those days Caesar Augustus
issued a decree

690
00:41:56,775 --> 00:41:59,801
that a census should be taken
of the entire Roman world.

691
00:41:59,878 --> 00:42:03,041
Everyone went to his hometown
to register. "

692
00:42:06,184 --> 00:42:07,845
- That it?
- Yep.

693
00:42:07,919 --> 00:42:10,251
That's an awesome
fucking story, kid.

694
00:42:10,322 --> 00:42:13,780
There's more to it, but we
have to wait till tomorrow.

695
00:42:15,193 --> 00:42:17,423
Do you want to eat
the chocolate?

696
00:42:18,497 --> 00:42:19,555
You go ahead.

697
00:42:22,768 --> 00:42:25,032
Are you coming downstairs?

698
00:42:25,103 --> 00:42:27,765
I'll be down in a minute.
I got to go to work.

699
00:42:39,184 --> 00:42:40,446
Fuck me?
Fuck you.

700
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:42,510
You can't just take up
with some kid.

701
00:42:42,587 --> 00:42:44,953
You don't know who's around
or what they do.

702
00:42:45,023 --> 00:42:47,457
You got some nerve,
you little shit, you.

703
00:42:47,526 --> 00:42:50,188
What, you're my mom now?
You shat me out of your womb?

704
00:42:50,262 --> 00:42:53,698
You said that yesterday,
you stupid fuck.

705
00:42:53,765 --> 00:42:55,392
Shit.

706
00:42:56,234 --> 00:42:58,134
Fuck you.

707
00:43:06,912 --> 00:43:09,210
You are by far the dumbest,

708
00:43:09,281 --> 00:43:11,909
most pathetic piece
of maggot-eating shit

709
00:43:11,983 --> 00:43:15,419
that has ever slid
from a human being's hairy ass.

710
00:43:16,288 --> 00:43:19,018
What if the kid has one of those
fucking playdates they have now?

711
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:21,820
Are you shitting me?
The kid don't have any friends.

712
00:43:21,893 --> 00:43:25,021
He don't even have an imaginary
friend unless he ditched him.

713
00:43:25,096 --> 00:43:28,065
He lives with his drooling-ass
old grandmother.

714
00:43:28,133 --> 00:43:29,828
Sits in front of the TV
all the time.

715
00:43:29,901 --> 00:43:31,300
You think she's gonna
rat me out?

716
00:43:31,369 --> 00:43:34,304
She don't know her ass
from last Tuesday.

717
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:36,305
You fuck her?

718
00:43:37,943 --> 00:43:39,069
Jesus Christ.

719
00:43:39,144 --> 00:43:41,044
Is everything fucking sex
with you?

720
00:43:41,112 --> 00:43:43,171
With me?
I fuck one person.

721
00:43:43,248 --> 00:43:44,772
I ain't out there
serial fornicating,

722
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:46,977
trying to float my liver,
drinking myself silly

723
00:43:47,052 --> 00:43:50,078
'cause I can't stand
what a piece of shit I am.

724
00:43:50,155 --> 00:43:52,885
What are you,
Sigmund Sawed-off Fucking Freud?

725
00:43:52,958 --> 00:43:54,585
Yeah, that's right.

726
00:43:54,659 --> 00:43:56,217
Go ahead.
Talk about my height.

727
00:43:56,294 --> 00:43:57,921
Make it about something safe

728
00:43:57,996 --> 00:43:59,861
'cause you're
an emotional cripple.

729
00:43:59,931 --> 00:44:01,489
Your soul is dog shit.

730
00:44:01,566 --> 00:44:04,057
Every single fucking thing
about you is ugly.

731
00:44:10,809 --> 00:44:13,334
Come on, Lois.
Let's get out of here.

732
00:44:23,255 --> 00:44:26,816
Look who's here, Jimmy.
It's Santa.

733
00:44:26,892 --> 00:44:28,416
That's fucking great.

734
00:44:28,493 --> 00:44:31,053
Let's tell him what you want
for Christmas.

735
00:44:31,529 --> 00:44:33,190
Fuck.

736
00:44:35,734 --> 00:44:39,864
I'm on my fucking
lunch break, okay?

737
00:44:39,938 --> 00:44:41,963
Are you insane?

738
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,837
Management's gonna hear
about this.

739
00:44:43,909 --> 00:44:46,343
You think that's a threat?

740
00:44:46,411 --> 00:44:49,574
If you think you can make my
life any worse, go right ahead.

741
00:44:49,648 --> 00:44:52,412
Be my fucking guest.
Take a shot.

742
00:45:01,726 --> 00:45:07,995
<i>It's the most wonderful time
of the year</i>

743
00:45:08,066 --> 00:45:09,863
<i>With the kids
jingle-belling</i>

744
00:45:09,935 --> 00:45:14,497
<i>And everyone telling you,
"Be of good cheer"</i>

745
00:45:14,572 --> 00:45:22,035
<i>It's the most wonderful time
of the year</i>

746
00:45:22,113 --> 00:45:24,240
Just looking.

747
00:45:24,316 --> 00:45:26,045
Aah!

748
00:45:31,723 --> 00:45:34,317
Find everything
you're looking for?

749
00:45:34,392 --> 00:45:36,622
Um, yeah.
Thank you.

750
00:45:36,695 --> 00:45:39,562
Nothing I can help
you with, huh?

751
00:45:39,631 --> 00:45:43,567
No. I'm just looking at
the games 'cause I have an Xbox.

752
00:45:43,635 --> 00:45:46,468
Get your hands
out of my pants, man!

753
00:45:46,538 --> 00:45:49,905
You're stealing from the store,
you're stealing from me.

754
00:45:49,975 --> 00:45:51,306
What is this?

755
00:45:51,376 --> 00:45:53,310
I was gonna pay for it.

756
00:45:53,378 --> 00:45:54,436
Wrong answer.

757
00:45:54,512 --> 00:45:56,412
When I look at you,
you know what I think?

758
00:45:56,481 --> 00:45:59,279
I think America has
a sad future ahead of it.

759
00:45:59,351 --> 00:46:01,876
And you're part
of this sorry-ass generation.

760
00:46:01,953 --> 00:46:03,545
What you want to be
when you grow up?

761
00:46:03,621 --> 00:46:05,919
I don't know.

762
00:46:05,991 --> 00:46:08,152
- This MP3?
- Yeah.

763
00:46:08,226 --> 00:46:09,591
Take it off.

764
00:46:09,661 --> 00:46:12,221
But my grandmother gave...

765
00:46:12,297 --> 00:46:14,731
Take it off. I don't care
who gave it to you.

766
00:46:14,799 --> 00:46:16,767
Take it off.

767
00:46:16,835 --> 00:46:18,735
I don't care if it choke you
to death.

768
00:46:18,803 --> 00:46:20,896
Now, I want you to get on
out of here. Get!

769
00:46:20,972 --> 00:46:22,599
- But can I have...
- Get!

770
00:46:22,674 --> 00:46:23,834
Happy Kwanzaa.

771
00:46:27,379 --> 00:46:29,347
And pull your damn pants up!

772
00:46:29,414 --> 00:46:31,279
What's wrong with you kids
these days?

773
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:33,812
Gin?

774
00:46:33,885 --> 00:46:35,614
- Yeah.
- What do you need?

775
00:46:35,687 --> 00:46:37,416
I need you to run a plate
for me.

776
00:46:37,489 --> 00:46:38,615
It's Arizona plates.

777
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:40,487
Hold on.
Let me get a pen.

778
00:47:07,419 --> 00:47:08,852
Is that it?

779
00:47:19,664 --> 00:47:23,600
For Christ's sake, make a move
and stick with it, would you?

780
00:47:31,709 --> 00:47:33,370
King me.

781
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:37,645
Son of a bitch!

782
00:47:37,715 --> 00:47:42,345
You lousy, cheating little shit!

783
00:47:44,189 --> 00:47:46,749
You're fucking with me!
You did that on purpose.

784
00:47:46,825 --> 00:47:49,385
You play like the dead lice
are falling off of you,

785
00:47:49,461 --> 00:47:52,294
and then suddenly, you're like
Seabiscuit all over the place.

786
00:47:52,363 --> 00:47:54,854
You're a smartass,
is what you are, kid.

787
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,663
Want to play again?

788
00:48:02,373 --> 00:48:03,965
Howdy.
Herb Gunner.

789
00:48:04,042 --> 00:48:06,408
I live two streets over
on Burning Trail Road.

790
00:48:06,478 --> 00:48:08,207
I don't think we've met.

791
00:48:11,116 --> 00:48:12,310
I'm Uncle Willie.

792
00:48:12,383 --> 00:48:15,147
I'm organizing the decorations
for the subdivision this year.

793
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:17,654
- You mind if I come in?
- Yeah.

794
00:48:17,722 --> 00:48:20,122
I mean yeah, I mind.

795
00:48:20,191 --> 00:48:21,385
Okay. Uh...

796
00:48:21,459 --> 00:48:25,418
Will you be participating in our
luminarias program this year?

797
00:48:27,465 --> 00:48:30,298
- What the hell is a lunamaria?
- They're luminarias.

798
00:48:30,368 --> 00:48:32,802
Small sacks filled with
about a pound of sand each.

799
00:48:32,871 --> 00:48:34,839
We insert a candle
in the middle, light it,

800
00:48:34,906 --> 00:48:36,237
and the bag glows.

801
00:48:36,307 --> 00:48:37,968
Then we line
all the sidewalks here

802
00:48:38,042 --> 00:48:40,408
all around the neighborhood.

803
00:48:41,012 --> 00:48:44,948
You see, we don't celebrate
Christmas around here, so...

804
00:48:45,016 --> 00:48:48,247
We're, uh, we're Muslims.

805
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:50,378
Look, it's my first year
running this.

806
00:48:50,455 --> 00:48:52,753
I'd like it if there weren't
any gaps in it.

807
00:48:52,824 --> 00:48:55,554
What if I come by
Christmas Eve and do it for you?

808
00:48:55,627 --> 00:48:57,720
No, you know what?
You don't have to do that.

809
00:48:57,795 --> 00:49:00,389
Yeah, me and the kid here,
we'll do something.

810
00:49:00,465 --> 00:49:01,727
Great.
I got the supplies.

811
00:49:01,799 --> 00:49:03,266
- I'll throw them in the garage.
- Perfect.

812
00:49:03,334 --> 00:49:05,234
Awesome.

813
00:49:05,303 --> 00:49:06,998
Going in the garage,
just so you know.

814
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:10,700
You can make
a delicious six-pound chicken.

815
00:49:10,775 --> 00:49:13,903
Enough hot dogs and sausages
to feed a small army.

816
00:49:13,978 --> 00:49:17,209
Not one, but two delicious
rotisserie chickens.

817
00:49:17,282 --> 00:49:19,750
Fuck me, Santa. Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa.

818
00:49:19,817 --> 00:49:22,684
Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa. Fuck me, Santa.

819
00:49:22,754 --> 00:49:25,746
Scrumptious
61/2-pound standing rib roast.

820
00:49:25,823 --> 00:49:30,487
And everybody's favorite,
baby back ribs.

821
00:49:43,741 --> 00:49:46,972
This is such a nice house.

822
00:49:47,045 --> 00:49:49,570
Needs a woman's touch, though.

823
00:49:49,647 --> 00:49:52,639
I just rent
the fucking place anyway.

824
00:49:55,486 --> 00:49:57,078
Yeah.
I just rent stuff, too.

825
00:49:57,155 --> 00:49:58,315
Yeah?

826
00:50:05,797 --> 00:50:07,924
How long are you gonna be here?

827
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:10,058
What? On the couch?

828
00:50:10,134 --> 00:50:11,761
No.

829
00:50:11,836 --> 00:50:13,565
In town.

830
00:50:15,139 --> 00:50:17,801
I don't know.
Just through the holidays.

831
00:50:17,875 --> 00:50:20,173
You know, then I'll move on.

832
00:50:22,547 --> 00:50:24,014
So, do you like kids?

833
00:50:25,216 --> 00:50:27,013
Fuck, no!

834
00:50:27,085 --> 00:50:29,553
Do you think
I'm some kind of pervert?

835
00:50:29,621 --> 00:50:32,522
I just mean because
you're Santa Claus.

836
00:50:33,558 --> 00:50:34,525
Oh.

837
00:50:34,592 --> 00:50:36,856
I like kids.
I really like kids.

838
00:50:36,928 --> 00:50:39,089
- You do?
- I love kids.

839
00:50:39,163 --> 00:50:40,824
Well, good.

840
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:45,160
Yeah, they're something else,
those kids.

841
00:50:47,305 --> 00:50:49,205
And to tell you the truth...

842
00:50:50,842 --> 00:50:54,903
The fact of the matter is,
I'm not Santa.

843
00:50:57,682 --> 00:51:00,173
Like ya anyway.

844
00:51:14,632 --> 00:51:16,964
So, you'll call me, right?

845
00:51:17,035 --> 00:51:19,799
Yeah.
I'll call you.

846
00:51:19,871 --> 00:51:21,202
I'm gonna buy you some flowers.

847
00:51:21,272 --> 00:51:23,706
Some of those
really good expensive ones.

848
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:25,037
Shut up.

849
00:51:27,312 --> 00:51:29,246
Bye.

850
00:52:36,814 --> 00:52:38,304
Roger, you're home.

851
00:52:38,383 --> 00:52:41,079
Let me fix you some sandwiches.

852
00:52:43,354 --> 00:52:44,343
What the fuck?

853
00:52:44,422 --> 00:52:47,823
Kid, what the fuck
is wrong with you?

854
00:52:52,864 --> 00:52:54,263
Jesus Christ!

855
00:52:54,332 --> 00:52:55,799
Let me see it!
Let me see it!

856
00:52:55,867 --> 00:52:57,164
What the hell happened to you?!

857
00:52:57,235 --> 00:53:00,466
I cut my hand by mistake!
Ow!

858
00:53:00,538 --> 00:53:03,098
- Of course it was by mistake.
- Ow!

859
00:53:03,174 --> 00:53:05,165
Here, hold still.
Hold still.

860
00:53:06,711 --> 00:53:08,906
I was just trying to help you!

861
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:11,847
I forgot to say,
"It's gonna sting a little bit. "

862
00:53:11,916 --> 00:53:14,407
Shouldn't I wrap it
in a T-shirt or something?

863
00:53:14,485 --> 00:53:16,180
God damn it.

864
00:53:20,658 --> 00:53:23,559
Hey, kid?

865
00:53:24,729 --> 00:53:27,289
Kid, you okay up there?

866
00:53:27,365 --> 00:53:29,890
You need a Band-Aid
or something?

867
00:53:39,143 --> 00:53:41,236
Aw, shit.

868
00:53:50,054 --> 00:53:51,248
You're late.

869
00:53:58,229 --> 00:53:59,821
Kids.
Let me tell you.

870
00:54:03,334 --> 00:54:05,165
They run you ragged.

871
00:54:16,848 --> 00:54:19,043
Morning, team.

872
00:54:19,584 --> 00:54:20,676
Hey, hey, hey.

873
00:54:20,751 --> 00:54:23,015
It's not quite 8:00 yet.

874
00:54:24,021 --> 00:54:26,046
Well, how close are we?

875
00:54:30,561 --> 00:54:31,892
Now it's 8:00.

876
00:54:31,963 --> 00:54:33,055
Merry Christmas.

877
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:35,098
Up your ass.

878
00:54:41,439 --> 00:54:42,804
God damn it!

879
00:54:42,874 --> 00:54:44,432
You tear your ball again?

880
00:54:44,509 --> 00:54:45,771
I don't think so.

881
00:54:45,843 --> 00:54:48,437
That's it.

882
00:55:04,962 --> 00:55:07,089
God damn it!

883
00:55:22,146 --> 00:55:24,171
Sweetheart,
don't romance 'em, now.

884
00:55:24,248 --> 00:55:25,909
Go on and get in there.
I can take it.

885
00:55:28,553 --> 00:55:29,451
Yeah.

886
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,511
Gin, I got the info
on that Arizona plate.

887
00:55:31,589 --> 00:55:33,557
All right.
Now you're talking.

888
00:55:33,624 --> 00:55:35,649
Oh, hold on one minute.

889
00:55:35,726 --> 00:55:38,126
Baby, baby. Baby, baby.
Don't use that one.

890
00:55:38,195 --> 00:55:39,253
That's not the stuff.

891
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:41,628
Use something
with some claws to it.

892
00:55:41,699 --> 00:55:44,099
Yeah, that hard candy.
That's it right there.

893
00:55:44,168 --> 00:55:47,433
Let me get some of that.
Yeah, that's it.

894
00:55:47,505 --> 00:55:48,836
Okay.

895
00:55:48,906 --> 00:55:49,838
Yeah, I'm back.

896
00:55:49,907 --> 00:55:51,340
The guy's Roger Merman.

897
00:55:51,409 --> 00:55:53,639
- Guess where he is.
- Give it to me.

898
00:55:53,711 --> 00:55:56,805
Ow! Damn it!
What's wrong with you, woman?

899
00:56:06,223 --> 00:56:07,815
Who are you?

900
00:56:07,892 --> 00:56:09,120
Your name Roger Merman?

901
00:56:09,193 --> 00:56:10,182
Yes. But...

902
00:56:10,261 --> 00:56:11,990
You doing three to six
for embezzlement?

903
00:56:12,063 --> 00:56:16,659
Uh, well, many accounting
questions are not cut-and-dried.

904
00:56:16,734 --> 00:56:19,168
Do you live at 41 Sage Terrace?

905
00:56:19,236 --> 00:56:21,204
Is it Grandma?

906
00:56:21,272 --> 00:56:22,466
Is my son all right?

907
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:23,871
They're fine.

908
00:56:23,941 --> 00:56:26,239
Do you have any houseguests?

909
00:56:26,944 --> 00:56:28,070
Houseguests?

910
00:56:29,981 --> 00:56:32,472
Thank you for your time.
God bless.

911
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:35,209
Well, hey, who are you?

912
00:56:37,488 --> 00:56:39,683
Houseguests?

913
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,320
Little trick I learned
up at the North Pole.

914
00:56:45,396 --> 00:56:48,160
If you fry baloney,
it tastes like a hot dog.

915
00:56:48,232 --> 00:56:50,132
I thought you
didn't like sandwiches.

916
00:56:50,201 --> 00:56:52,135
Yeah, but this
is not a sandwich.

917
00:56:52,203 --> 00:56:53,761
A sandwich has
two pieces of bread

918
00:56:53,838 --> 00:56:55,669
with a bunch of junk on it.

919
00:56:56,907 --> 00:56:58,431
It's like a tostada.

920
00:56:58,509 --> 00:57:01,103
This isn't a tostada.

921
00:57:01,178 --> 00:57:02,509
There you go, Granny.

922
00:57:03,514 --> 00:57:05,846
Little salsa here.

923
00:57:06,917 --> 00:57:09,317
Now it's a tostada.

924
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,683
Have you seen
my Advent calendar?

925
00:57:11,756 --> 00:57:14,156
What the fuck is it
with the Advent calendar?

926
00:57:14,225 --> 00:57:16,386
Why are you so obsessed
with that goddamn thing?

927
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:18,451
The story sucks anyway.

928
00:57:22,533 --> 00:57:24,091
I think I saw it in the hallway.

929
00:57:24,168 --> 00:57:25,897
- Really?
- I think so.

930
00:57:34,679 --> 00:57:37,443
Looks like someone messed
with my Advent calendar.

931
00:57:37,515 --> 00:57:40,075
What are you talking about?
Let me see.

932
00:57:41,318 --> 00:57:43,684
Nobody messed with it.
It looks fine.

933
00:57:58,335 --> 00:58:01,099
There's a candy corn
in this one.

934
00:58:01,172 --> 00:58:03,800
Well, they can't all be winners,
can they?

935
00:58:08,746 --> 00:58:11,715
Well, it's fucked.

936
00:58:11,782 --> 00:58:13,181
Yeah?

937
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:14,877
Yeah.

938
00:58:14,952 --> 00:58:16,647
- Fucked, frankly.
- He's...

939
00:58:16,721 --> 00:58:18,313
- Clean...
- Oh.

940
00:58:18,389 --> 00:58:20,084
- As a fucking whistle.
- Nothing?

941
00:58:20,157 --> 00:58:21,454
- No.
- Oh.

942
00:58:21,525 --> 00:58:23,459
- Nothing. I mean shit.
- Yeah.

943
00:58:23,527 --> 00:58:24,789
- He curses.
- Yeah?

944
00:58:24,862 --> 00:58:26,659
- But never around children.
- Oh.

945
00:58:26,731 --> 00:58:28,164
- No criminal record.
- Yeah.

946
00:58:28,232 --> 00:58:30,826
- No parking tickets.
- Nothing.

947
00:58:30,901 --> 00:58:32,994
- No bad habits, even.
- Oh.

948
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:34,367
Sex, yeah.

949
00:58:34,438 --> 00:58:37,100
- But man is a sexual being.
- Yeah.

950
00:58:37,174 --> 00:58:38,971
- Fuckin' Darwinian.
- Oh.

951
00:58:39,043 --> 00:58:41,102
- You can't do shit about that.
- No.

952
00:58:41,178 --> 00:58:42,873
Hell, I wouldn't want to.

953
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:49,342
No, of course not.
I'm not advocating celibacy.

954
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:52,184
Hope not. It'd be the end
of the fucking human race.

955
00:58:52,256 --> 00:58:54,019
Yeah.

956
00:58:54,091 --> 00:58:55,752
Fucks large women.

957
00:58:56,627 --> 00:58:58,288
What can I say?

958
00:59:11,308 --> 00:59:13,799
Hey, look,
it's the retard again.

959
00:59:24,655 --> 00:59:25,622
Wedgie.

960
00:59:25,689 --> 00:59:27,350
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

961
00:59:29,727 --> 00:59:31,194
Well, what the hell do you want?

962
00:59:31,262 --> 00:59:32,661
Pokémon!

963
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:34,095
Done.

964
00:59:38,469 --> 00:59:41,700
You probably shouldn't
be digging in your ass.

965
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:44,771
Santa...

966
00:59:46,343 --> 00:59:48,140
Oh, jeez.

967
00:59:51,482 --> 00:59:53,882
- Is that your underwear?
- Part of it.

968
00:59:53,951 --> 00:59:55,748
Where the hell's the rest of it?

969
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:58,288
No, actually, don't tell me.
What do you want?

970
00:59:58,355 --> 01:00:01,916
I was thinking I wanted a purple
stuffed elephant, not pink.

971
01:00:01,992 --> 01:00:03,687
But now I changed my mind.

972
01:00:03,761 --> 01:00:06,696
- Yeah, what?
- Now I don't want an elephant.

973
01:00:06,764 --> 01:00:08,322
I want a gorilla named Davey

974
01:00:08,399 --> 01:00:11,266
for beating up the skateboard
kids who pull on my underwear.

975
01:00:11,335 --> 01:00:13,701
He could take his orders
from the talking walnut,

976
01:00:13,771 --> 01:00:16,205
so it wouldn't be my bad thing.

977
01:00:20,811 --> 01:00:22,039
Jesus, kid.

978
01:00:22,112 --> 01:00:24,376
When I was your age,
I didn't need no gorilla,

979
01:00:24,448 --> 01:00:26,416
and I wasn't as big
as one of your legs.

980
01:00:26,483 --> 01:00:28,883
Four kids beat me up
and I went crying to my daddy.

981
01:00:28,953 --> 01:00:30,818
- You know what he did?
- He made it all better?

982
01:00:30,888 --> 01:00:33,652
No, he kicked my ass.
You know why?

983
01:00:33,724 --> 01:00:36,625
'Cause you went to the bathroom
on Mommy's dishes?

984
01:00:36,694 --> 01:00:38,286
What the fuck?

985
01:00:38,362 --> 01:00:39,226
No.

986
01:00:39,296 --> 01:00:41,958
He tried to teach you
not to cry and be a man?

987
01:00:42,032 --> 01:00:46,196
No. It's because he was
a mean, drunk son of a bitch.

988
01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:47,931
When he wasn't busting my ass,

989
01:00:48,005 --> 01:00:49,836
he was putting cigarettes out
on my neck.

990
01:00:49,907 --> 01:00:51,238
The world ain't fair.

991
01:00:51,308 --> 01:00:53,708
You gotta take what you need
when you can get it.

992
01:00:53,777 --> 01:00:56,473
Learn to stand up for yourself.
Quit being a pussy.

993
01:00:56,547 --> 01:00:59,209
Kick these kids
in the balls or something.

994
01:01:00,851 --> 01:01:02,409
Or don't.
Shit, I don't care.

995
01:01:02,486 --> 01:01:04,977
Just leave me out of it.
Now, get on out of here.

996
01:01:05,055 --> 01:01:07,580
Okay.
Thanks, Santa.

997
01:01:22,039 --> 01:01:24,507
Go get the next lucky boy
or girl, okay?

998
01:01:25,843 --> 01:01:27,606
All right, next.

999
01:01:29,446 --> 01:01:31,778
Open the ropes there, Marcus.

1000
01:01:32,816 --> 01:01:34,010
I know you?

1001
01:01:34,084 --> 01:01:35,108
Not yet.

1002
01:01:37,321 --> 01:01:39,585
Seven cities in seven years.

1003
01:01:39,657 --> 01:01:41,318
Pretty impressive.

1004
01:01:41,392 --> 01:01:43,690
The store changes,
your name changes.

1005
01:01:43,761 --> 01:01:46,229
But you always get away clean.

1006
01:01:46,297 --> 01:01:47,559
Yeah.

1007
01:01:47,631 --> 01:01:49,531
Pretty darn impressive.

1008
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,192
Well, let's face the facts.

1009
01:01:51,268 --> 01:01:53,498
Y'all are a couple
of half-bucket small-timers.

1010
01:01:53,570 --> 01:01:56,801
You, because of your physical
attributes, found a niche,

1011
01:01:56,874 --> 01:01:58,398
and I respect that.

1012
01:01:58,475 --> 01:02:00,500
But you also been caught...

1013
01:02:01,612 --> 01:02:02,738
...by me.

1014
01:02:02,813 --> 01:02:05,646
So this is how it's gonna be.

1015
01:02:05,716 --> 01:02:07,343
I don't want to take over.

1016
01:02:07,418 --> 01:02:09,682
I don't even want to change
your scam.

1017
01:02:09,753 --> 01:02:11,846
Whatever you guys do, it works.

1018
01:02:11,922 --> 01:02:13,822
All I want is a taste.

1019
01:02:13,891 --> 01:02:16,416
When the deed is done,
we part ways.

1020
01:02:16,493 --> 01:02:18,324
I'll buy a little ranch
in Havasu,

1021
01:02:18,395 --> 01:02:21,762
and you all take your little
medicine show back on the road.

1022
01:02:24,401 --> 01:02:25,698
- How much?
- Half.

1023
01:02:25,769 --> 01:02:28,067
No way! You don't know
who you're fucking with.

1024
01:02:28,138 --> 01:02:31,301
Back off, Will.
I got this. I got this!

1025
01:02:32,710 --> 01:02:34,575
Okay. 30%.

1026
01:02:34,645 --> 01:02:37,443
There's three of us.
30%. That's fair.

1027
01:02:37,514 --> 01:02:39,209
Half.

1028
01:02:39,283 --> 01:02:40,580
I meant 33%...

1029
01:02:40,651 --> 01:02:41,515
I meant half.

1030
01:02:41,585 --> 01:02:42,609
...and 1/3.

1031
01:02:42,686 --> 01:02:44,176
Half.

1032
01:02:45,489 --> 01:02:46,683
35%.

1033
01:02:47,624 --> 01:02:48,352
Half.

1034
01:02:48,425 --> 01:02:50,086
40%.

1035
01:02:51,261 --> 01:02:52,694
Half.

1036
01:02:54,732 --> 01:02:56,097
42%.

1037
01:02:58,268 --> 01:02:59,633
Half.

1038
01:03:04,608 --> 01:03:05,768
45%.

1039
01:03:11,815 --> 01:03:13,407
Half.

1040
01:03:14,518 --> 01:03:15,507
48%?

1041
01:03:16,687 --> 01:03:18,746
Half.

1042
01:03:19,490 --> 01:03:20,514
49%.

1043
01:03:20,591 --> 01:03:22,024
Half.

1044
01:03:23,694 --> 01:03:25,559
Well, what's one point?

1045
01:03:25,629 --> 01:03:27,563
We split the dough
right down the middle.

1046
01:03:27,631 --> 01:03:30,099
Any merchandise you take, I get
to look at and cherry-pick.

1047
01:03:30,167 --> 01:03:32,499
No! Money's one thing,
but you ain't gettin' the...

1048
01:03:32,569 --> 01:03:35,003
This ain't no Chinese menu,
jagoff.

1049
01:03:35,072 --> 01:03:37,632
I tell you how it's gonna be.

1050
01:03:37,708 --> 01:03:40,074
This is pricks fix.

1051
01:03:45,549 --> 01:03:46,607
Pricks fix?

1052
01:03:46,683 --> 01:03:48,617
He's a fucking moron.

1053
01:03:48,685 --> 01:03:49,583
Oh, really?

1054
01:03:49,653 --> 01:03:51,450
Is that how you got
the upper hand?

1055
01:03:51,522 --> 01:03:52,420
Fuck you.

1056
01:03:52,489 --> 01:03:53,478
Negotiating?

1057
01:03:53,557 --> 01:03:55,422
If you don't like,
next year, fuck off.

1058
01:03:55,492 --> 01:03:57,255
I can always get
another box jockey.

1059
01:03:57,327 --> 01:03:58,692
I can get another midget, too.

1060
01:03:58,762 --> 01:03:59,990
Yeah, where?

1061
01:04:00,064 --> 01:04:03,090
You see us hanging off of trees
like fucking crab apples?

1062
01:04:03,167 --> 01:04:05,601
Even if we did, you'd never
front your own racket.

1063
01:04:05,669 --> 01:04:08,001
You know why, Willie?
You got no discipline.

1064
01:04:08,072 --> 01:04:11,405
You got zero fuckin' initiative.
You'd fall apart without me.

1065
01:04:11,475 --> 01:04:13,102
You're too pathetic for words.

1066
01:04:13,177 --> 01:04:15,941
You're a fucking loser,
and you fucking know it.

1067
01:04:23,687 --> 01:04:26,247
<i>To go glidin'
in a one-horse sleigh</i>

1068
01:04:26,323 --> 01:04:29,383
<i>Giddyup, jingle horse,
pick up your feet</i>

1069
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:32,827
<i>Jingle around the clock</i>

1070
01:04:32,896 --> 01:04:36,525
<i>Mix and mingle
in the jinglin' beat</i>

1071
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,431
<i>That's the jingle bell rock</i>

1072
01:04:38,502 --> 01:04:42,336
Santa'll be here real soon,
kids. Real soon.

1073
01:04:42,406 --> 01:04:45,739
<i>Jingle bells chime
in jingle bell time</i>

1074
01:04:45,809 --> 01:04:47,606
There he is.
Look.

1075
01:04:47,678 --> 01:04:49,976
<i>In jingle bell square</i>

1076
01:04:50,047 --> 01:04:52,572
Oh, no.

1077
01:04:52,649 --> 01:04:56,050
<i>What a bright time,
it's the right time</i>

1078
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:58,714
<i>To rock the night away</i>

1079
01:04:58,789 --> 01:05:01,189
Oh, my God!

1080
01:05:01,258 --> 01:05:03,226
<i>Is a swell time</i>

1081
01:05:03,293 --> 01:05:06,387
<i>To go glidin'
in a one-horse sleigh</i>

1082
01:05:06,463 --> 01:05:09,626
<i>Giddyup, jingle horse,
pick up your feet</i>

1083
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:12,828
<i>Jingle around the clock</i>

1084
01:05:12,903 --> 01:05:16,703
<i>Mix and mingle
in the jinglin' beat...</i>

1085
01:05:29,887 --> 01:05:31,878
Sweet Jews for Jesus.

1086
01:05:31,955 --> 01:05:33,980
I pissed myself.

1087
01:05:34,057 --> 01:05:35,752
What the fuck
do you think you doing?

1088
01:05:35,826 --> 01:05:37,657
You son of a bitch!

1089
01:05:37,728 --> 01:05:38,888
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey.

1090
01:05:38,962 --> 01:05:40,327
Hey, come on, come on.

1091
01:05:40,397 --> 01:05:42,024
Look, hey!
Come on, come on!

1092
01:05:42,099 --> 01:05:44,033
Look here.
Get him out of here.

1093
01:05:44,101 --> 01:05:45,728
I'll smooth things over
with Chipeska.

1094
01:05:45,802 --> 01:05:48,566
- Tell him food poisoning.
- "Get him out of here"?

1095
01:05:48,639 --> 01:05:49,970
Take him to the car.

1096
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:53,032
In case you hadn't noticed,
I'm a motherfuckin' dwarf.

1097
01:05:53,110 --> 01:05:55,101
So unless you got
a forklift handy,

1098
01:05:55,179 --> 01:05:57,113
maybe you should
lend a hand, hmm?

1099
01:05:57,181 --> 01:05:59,240
That figures. You want
all kind of set-asides.

1100
01:05:59,316 --> 01:06:01,181
Special treatment
'cause you're handicapped.

1101
01:06:01,251 --> 01:06:02,149
You all the same.

1102
01:06:02,219 --> 01:06:03,311
Special treatment?

1103
01:06:03,387 --> 01:06:05,719
I'm 3-foot-fucking-tall,
you asshole!

1104
01:06:05,789 --> 01:06:07,381
It's a matter of physics.

1105
01:06:07,457 --> 01:06:09,925
Draw me a sketch of how
I get him to the car, huh?

1106
01:06:09,993 --> 01:06:11,756
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

1107
01:06:11,828 --> 01:06:13,455
Sketch it up, you moron.

1108
01:06:13,530 --> 01:06:16,090
Fucking Leonardo da Vinci.

1109
01:06:17,367 --> 01:06:18,834
What you call me, thigh high?

1110
01:06:18,902 --> 01:06:20,563
I called you
a fucking guinea homo

1111
01:06:20,637 --> 01:06:22,969
from the 15th-fucking-century,
you dickhead!

1112
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:25,133
I could stick you up my ass,
small fry.

1113
01:06:25,209 --> 01:06:27,871
Yeah? You sure it ain't
too sore from last night?

1114
01:06:27,945 --> 01:06:29,776
You got some lip on you, midget.

1115
01:06:29,846 --> 01:06:32,679
Well, these lips were on
your wife's pussy last night.

1116
01:06:32,749 --> 01:06:35,513
Why don't you dust that
thing off once in a while?

1117
01:06:35,586 --> 01:06:37,144
Asshole.

1118
01:06:41,625 --> 01:06:42,922
I pissed my pants.

1119
01:06:42,993 --> 01:06:44,324
Oh, shut up.

1120
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:11,019
Santa.

1121
01:07:20,697 --> 01:07:22,324
Santa?

1122
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:25,099
What?

1123
01:07:26,403 --> 01:07:28,200
What are you doing?

1124
01:07:29,573 --> 01:07:31,040
Nothing.

1125
01:07:32,075 --> 01:07:34,043
You going to work today?

1126
01:07:37,414 --> 01:07:39,279
Not really.

1127
01:07:39,349 --> 01:07:42,079
You just gonna sit there?

1128
01:07:44,221 --> 01:07:45,153
Yeah.

1129
01:07:45,222 --> 01:07:47,918
Just let me alone, okay?

1130
01:07:51,395 --> 01:07:53,363
Hey, wait a minute.
Hey, kid?

1131
01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:54,897
Yeah?

1132
01:07:58,935 --> 01:08:00,800
I want you to take this letter.

1133
01:08:00,871 --> 01:08:05,001
When the paramedics come
to bag Santa up,

1134
01:08:05,075 --> 01:08:07,100
there's gonna be
some cops there.

1135
01:08:07,177 --> 01:08:10,374
I want you to make sure that
those cops get that envelope.

1136
01:08:10,447 --> 01:08:12,312
What is it?

1137
01:08:12,382 --> 01:08:15,374
It just tells
all the bad things that...

1138
01:08:17,788 --> 01:08:20,279
What the fuck happened
to your eye?

1139
01:08:21,491 --> 01:08:22,924
Fucking little prick!

1140
01:08:25,762 --> 01:08:28,526
So you like to give little kids
black eyes, huh?

1141
01:08:31,034 --> 01:08:33,161
How 'bout you, huh?!
You want some?!

1142
01:08:33,236 --> 01:08:35,830
Anybody else?
Anybody else? Come on!

1143
01:08:35,906 --> 01:08:37,635
Yeah, there you go.

1144
01:08:55,592 --> 01:08:58,220
You know, I think
I've turned a corner.

1145
01:08:58,962 --> 01:09:02,398
Yeah?
You fucking petites now?

1146
01:09:02,466 --> 01:09:04,832
No. I'm not talking about that.

1147
01:09:06,937 --> 01:09:10,498
I beat the shit
out of some kids today.

1148
01:09:10,574 --> 01:09:12,838
But it was for a purpose.

1149
01:09:15,212 --> 01:09:17,806
It made me feel good
about myself.

1150
01:09:19,449 --> 01:09:22,009
It was like I did something
constructive with my life.

1151
01:09:22,085 --> 01:09:23,848
I don't know.

1152
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:26,252
Like I accomplished something.

1153
01:09:29,626 --> 01:09:32,493
You need many years of therapy.

1154
01:09:32,562 --> 01:09:36,623
Many, many, many
fuckin' years of therapy.

1155
01:09:37,401 --> 01:09:39,961
Okay. You don't drink,
which is smart on your part.

1156
01:09:40,036 --> 01:09:42,129
But being sober can put you
at a disadvantage

1157
01:09:42,205 --> 01:09:43,672
when it comes to violence.

1158
01:09:43,740 --> 01:09:45,901
I can't box worth a shit, see.

1159
01:09:45,976 --> 01:09:49,810
But I'm good in a fight
because I can't feel anything.

1160
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:52,405
You, you're gonna feel
everything.

1161
01:09:53,683 --> 01:09:55,150
Okay.

1162
01:09:55,218 --> 01:09:58,915
Now put your dukes up.
Let me see what you got.

1163
01:09:58,989 --> 01:10:00,013
This is bullshit!

1164
01:10:00,090 --> 01:10:03,423
Give me one good reason why I
should even consider doing this.

1165
01:10:03,493 --> 01:10:06,018
'Cause I let 2,000 kids
spit in my face for your ass.

1166
01:10:06,096 --> 01:10:07,154
That's why.

1167
01:10:07,230 --> 01:10:08,993
Now, I'm asking you
for this one thing.

1168
01:10:09,065 --> 01:10:10,760
Come on, look at the kid.

1169
01:10:12,202 --> 01:10:13,464
He is pathetic.

1170
01:10:13,537 --> 01:10:15,129
Yeah, he's just a little...

1171
01:10:15,205 --> 01:10:17,366
He's a fucking retard.

1172
01:10:18,575 --> 01:10:20,702
Yeah, let's show him
a couple of things

1173
01:10:20,777 --> 01:10:22,108
so he can defend himself, then.

1174
01:10:22,179 --> 01:10:23,806
Unless you're scared.

1175
01:10:25,248 --> 01:10:27,045
All right,
here's what's gonna happen.

1176
01:10:27,117 --> 01:10:28,516
Marcus is a bully, right?

1177
01:10:28,585 --> 01:10:30,553
He's gonna pull your underwear
up out of your pants.

1178
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:31,848
Now, what do you do?

1179
01:10:31,922 --> 01:10:32,980
I don't know.

1180
01:10:33,056 --> 01:10:34,318
God damn it!
You don't know?

1181
01:10:34,391 --> 01:10:37,724
If somebody wants to pull your
underwear up out of your pants,

1182
01:10:37,794 --> 01:10:38,988
you have to get mad.

1183
01:10:39,062 --> 01:10:41,189
Yeah, kid, come on.
Get mad.

1184
01:10:41,264 --> 01:10:42,663
Scream at him.

1185
01:10:44,901 --> 01:10:45,890
Jesus fucking Christ.

1186
01:10:45,969 --> 01:10:48,301
Listen at him.
He's a fucking faggot.

1187
01:10:49,206 --> 01:10:50,639
Loud! Scream!

1188
01:10:50,707 --> 01:10:52,641
Be loud! Be mean!

1189
01:10:52,709 --> 01:10:53,903
Piss him off!
Come on!

1190
01:10:53,977 --> 01:10:55,205
Aah!

1191
01:11:00,617 --> 01:11:03,745
You don't
hit people in the balls,

1192
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:04,980
you asshole!

1193
01:11:05,055 --> 01:11:07,023
Aah!

1194
01:11:07,090 --> 01:11:09,422
What the fuck's wrong with you?
He's just a kid.

1195
01:11:09,493 --> 01:11:11,393
- Fuck you, Willie!
- Ow!

1196
01:11:12,128 --> 01:11:13,891
God damn it.

1197
01:11:13,964 --> 01:11:15,625
I told you
I didn't want to do this!

1198
01:11:15,699 --> 01:11:17,667
Making me...
Ohh!

1199
01:11:19,202 --> 01:11:21,102
Oh, shit.

1200
01:11:23,607 --> 01:11:26,974
Kid, maybe you shouldn't spend
so much time around me.

1201
01:11:28,345 --> 01:11:30,506
You sneaky little prick.

1202
01:11:31,715 --> 01:11:34,183
Fuck you!
Little bastard!

1203
01:11:34,251 --> 01:11:35,582
Get off me!

1204
01:11:42,826 --> 01:11:46,091
Shut up. That's not even
what you said.

1205
01:11:46,162 --> 01:11:47,925
Oh, God damn it,
I forgot about that.

1206
01:11:47,998 --> 01:11:50,626
We got a fucking nursing home
around here.

1207
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:52,827
Well, we can go in another room.

1208
01:11:57,841 --> 01:12:00,275
She does look kind of still,
doesn't she?

1209
01:12:03,213 --> 01:12:04,737
Hey, Granny?

1210
01:12:07,684 --> 01:12:09,447
Hey, Granny.

1211
01:12:15,225 --> 01:12:17,489
Hey, there, Granny?

1212
01:12:17,561 --> 01:12:19,256
Oh, Granny.

1213
01:12:21,531 --> 01:12:22,498
Oh, my God.

1214
01:12:22,566 --> 01:12:24,090
What the fuck?

1215
01:12:26,603 --> 01:12:27,797
Oh, shit.

1216
01:12:31,341 --> 01:12:32,569
- Roger!
- God!

1217
01:12:32,642 --> 01:12:35,236
- God damn it! Shit!
- You're home.

1218
01:12:35,312 --> 01:12:38,907
- Please just tap me.
- Let me fix some sandwiches.

1219
01:13:14,484 --> 01:13:15,678
Hello, little boy.

1220
01:13:15,752 --> 01:13:17,310
Hello.
Santa...

1221
01:13:17,387 --> 01:13:20,117
I know that Christmas Eve
is in a couple days,

1222
01:13:20,190 --> 01:13:21,748
and you have to fly around
the world

1223
01:13:21,825 --> 01:13:25,989
and give presents to everyone,
and you won't be around anymore.

1224
01:13:26,062 --> 01:13:26,994
Yeah?

1225
01:13:27,063 --> 01:13:29,588
So I thought I'd give you
your present now.

1226
01:13:36,473 --> 01:13:37,565
What the fuck is it?

1227
01:13:37,641 --> 01:13:39,506
It's a wooden pickle.

1228
01:13:41,044 --> 01:13:43,569
- Why'd you paint it brown?
- It's not paint.

1229
01:13:43,647 --> 01:13:47,048
It's blood from when I cut
my hand making it for you.

1230
01:13:48,652 --> 01:13:49,880
Oh.

1231
01:13:49,953 --> 01:13:52,285
Well, shit, kid, I don't know.

1232
01:13:52,355 --> 01:13:54,016
I...

1233
01:13:55,492 --> 01:13:57,551
Thanks.

1234
01:13:57,627 --> 01:13:59,492
You're welcome.

1235
01:13:59,562 --> 01:14:00,995
Good night, Santa.

1236
01:14:02,732 --> 01:14:05,895
Good night, Mrs. Santa's sister.

1237
01:14:06,670 --> 01:14:08,535
Good night, sweetie.

1238
01:14:11,007 --> 01:14:12,941
Oh, my God.

1239
01:14:13,009 --> 01:14:14,442
That was so sweet.

1240
01:14:14,511 --> 01:14:17,480
He's a really sweet kid,
isn't he?

1241
01:14:17,547 --> 01:14:19,708
Yeah, I guess so.

1242
01:14:22,519 --> 01:14:24,453
Come on, baby.

1243
01:14:25,188 --> 01:14:26,746
Come here.

1244
01:14:28,124 --> 01:14:29,614
What?

1245
01:14:29,693 --> 01:14:31,888
Oh, nothing.
I'm all right.

1246
01:14:35,732 --> 01:14:37,791
Just a little tired.

1247
01:14:37,867 --> 01:14:39,698
Oh.

1248
01:14:49,579 --> 01:14:50,773
Santa!

1249
01:14:50,847 --> 01:14:53,042
God damn it!
Whoa! Shit!

1250
01:14:53,116 --> 01:14:55,346
Want to see my report card?

1251
01:14:55,418 --> 01:14:57,249
You scared the holy shit
out of me.

1252
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:58,582
Think I did good?

1253
01:14:58,655 --> 01:15:01,715
How would I know? I haven't seen
the fuckin' thing yet.

1254
01:15:06,696 --> 01:15:08,163
Who the fuck is Thurman?

1255
01:15:08,231 --> 01:15:10,893
- Is your name Thurman?
- Yeah.

1256
01:15:12,769 --> 01:15:14,134
Thurman Merman?

1257
01:15:14,204 --> 01:15:15,762
Yeah.

1258
01:15:17,407 --> 01:15:18,965
Jesus.

1259
01:15:19,042 --> 01:15:20,805
So, you think I did good?

1260
01:15:23,513 --> 01:15:26,949
What do you care
what I think, anyway?

1261
01:15:27,016 --> 01:15:29,143
Hell, I guess you did better
than I did.

1262
01:15:29,219 --> 01:15:31,585
I never got any B's.

1263
01:15:31,654 --> 01:15:34,179
I thought maybe at least
since I did good in school,

1264
01:15:34,257 --> 01:15:35,815
maybe you'd bring me a present.

1265
01:15:35,892 --> 01:15:37,757
'Cause last year
and the year before that,

1266
01:15:37,827 --> 01:15:39,954
you didn't bring me
any presents.

1267
01:15:43,032 --> 01:15:45,364
Even though I'm a dipshit loser.

1268
01:15:49,606 --> 01:15:51,767
Jesus fucking Christ, kid!

1269
01:15:51,841 --> 01:15:54,901
Why do you talk about
yourself that way?!

1270
01:15:54,978 --> 01:15:58,141
Let me give you some news.
I'm not Santa Claus, all right?

1271
01:15:58,214 --> 01:16:00,705
Take a look at me.
Do I look like Santa Claus?

1272
01:16:00,784 --> 01:16:03,252
As a matter of fact,
I'm living fucking proof

1273
01:16:03,319 --> 01:16:05,549
that there's not a Santa Claus.

1274
01:16:06,289 --> 01:16:08,450
I know there's no Santa.

1275
01:16:08,525 --> 01:16:10,959
I just thought maybe you'd
want to give me a present

1276
01:16:11,027 --> 01:16:12,722
'cause we're friends.

1277
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:38,882
There he is.

1278
01:16:38,955 --> 01:16:42,755
That lousy, leather-faced,
frog-eyed, motherfucker.

1279
01:16:42,826 --> 01:16:45,124
- Good night, Gin.
- Good night.

1280
01:17:17,227 --> 01:17:19,252
Jesus, Mother Mary, and Joseph.

1281
01:17:19,329 --> 01:17:20,626
What is the problem now?

1282
01:17:20,697 --> 01:17:22,392
I'm sorry.
The van stalled.

1283
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,761
Will you give us a jump, please?

1284
01:17:25,835 --> 01:17:27,735
I'll be dipped in dog shit.

1285
01:17:27,804 --> 01:17:29,863
Do I look like
an auto mechanic to you?

1286
01:17:37,146 --> 01:17:39,114
I appreciate it.

1287
01:17:41,718 --> 01:17:44,346
All right, small fry,
help yourself.

1288
01:17:48,958 --> 01:17:50,050
I can't reach it.

1289
01:17:50,126 --> 01:17:51,787
Jesus Christ, give me that.

1290
01:17:51,861 --> 01:17:53,055
Thanks.

1291
01:17:55,465 --> 01:17:56,432
All right, hit it.

1292
01:18:27,230 --> 01:18:30,256
Oh, my.
What a terrible accident.

1293
01:18:30,333 --> 01:18:31,459
Mm-mm-mmm.

1294
01:18:31,534 --> 01:18:32,899
- Is he dead?
- No.

1295
01:18:32,969 --> 01:18:35,335
But it looks like
you broke most of his ribs.

1296
01:18:35,405 --> 01:18:40,035
I'd say maybe 50% of them,
or do you think 30%?

1297
01:18:40,109 --> 01:18:41,838
I needed more
of a running start.

1298
01:18:41,911 --> 01:18:44,175
I couldn't build up
enough speed.

1299
01:19:00,229 --> 01:19:02,459
Merry Christmas Eve.

1300
01:19:03,333 --> 01:19:06,029
Got you a little something.

1301
01:19:06,102 --> 01:19:07,967
You shouldn't have.

1302
01:19:08,037 --> 01:19:10,335
You should put that stuff
in the kitchen.

1303
01:19:13,109 --> 01:19:15,407
God damn, you look good.

1304
01:19:20,049 --> 01:19:22,745
Here you go.

1305
01:19:24,153 --> 01:19:27,645
Little behind there, sweetie?

1306
01:19:27,724 --> 01:19:30,022
We don't need any more
of this shit.

1307
01:19:30,093 --> 01:19:34,120
"Christmas keeps us connected
to each other in peace.

1308
01:19:34,197 --> 01:19:37,894
The angel is going to tell
everyone in the world. "

1309
01:19:42,472 --> 01:19:43,700
Aspirin?

1310
01:19:43,773 --> 01:19:46,003
<i>As in olden days</i>

1311
01:19:46,075 --> 01:19:51,809
<i>Happy golden days of yore</i>

1312
01:19:51,881 --> 01:19:56,011
<i>Faithful friends
who are dear to us</i>

1313
01:19:56,085 --> 01:20:02,115
<i>Gather near to us once more</i>

1314
01:20:02,191 --> 01:20:07,424
<i>Through the years,
we all will be together</i>

1315
01:20:07,497 --> 01:20:11,957
<i>If the fates allow</i>

1316
01:20:12,035 --> 01:20:20,875
<i>Until then, we'll have to
muddle through somehow</i>

1317
01:20:20,943 --> 01:20:29,282
<i>So have yourself
a merry little Christmas now</i>

1318
01:20:32,088 --> 01:20:37,720
<i>Through the years,
we all will be together</i>

1319
01:20:37,794 --> 01:20:42,094
<i>If the fates allow</i>

1320
01:20:42,165 --> 01:20:50,595
<i>Hang a shining star
upon the highest bough</i>

1321
01:20:50,673 --> 01:20:54,234
<i>And have yourself</i>

1322
01:20:54,310 --> 01:21:02,149
<i>A merry little Christmas</i>

1323
01:21:02,218 --> 01:21:06,621
<i>Now</i>

1324
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:12,159
Shit!

1325
01:21:12,228 --> 01:21:13,855
Jesus.

1326
01:21:16,399 --> 01:21:17,457
Santa?

1327
01:21:19,502 --> 01:21:22,198
- What?
- I was gonna make sandwiches.

1328
01:21:22,271 --> 01:21:24,899
I could make you one
before you leave.

1329
01:21:27,276 --> 01:21:29,210
Listen, kid, I don't know.

1330
01:21:29,278 --> 01:21:32,372
I got shit to do and everything.

1331
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:39,447
Okay, make me some sandwiches.

1332
01:21:39,522 --> 01:21:41,649
I gotta go to the mall
and talk to somebody.

1333
01:21:41,724 --> 01:21:42,782
I'll be back.

1334
01:21:42,859 --> 01:21:43,655
For dinner?

1335
01:21:43,726 --> 01:21:45,557
Yeah, that's what I said.
Yeah.

1336
01:21:45,628 --> 01:21:47,721
How many sandwiches do you want?

1337
01:21:48,631 --> 01:21:50,826
Uh, a bunch.

1338
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:52,959
How much lettuce do you want?

1339
01:21:55,605 --> 01:21:57,402
I don't know.
The usual amount.

1340
01:21:57,473 --> 01:21:59,566
Whatever the hell people do.
Whatever you think.

1341
01:21:59,642 --> 01:22:00,973
Okay.

1342
01:22:19,362 --> 01:22:20,158
Have a very merry Christmas.

1343
01:22:20,196 --> 01:22:21,925
- Merry Christmas.
- Good night.

1344
01:22:21,998 --> 01:22:23,329
Merry Christmas.

1345
01:22:23,399 --> 01:22:24,525
Good night.

1346
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:26,192
- Good night.
- Okay! Happy holiday!

1347
01:22:26,269 --> 01:22:27,736
Attention, shoppers.

1348
01:22:27,803 --> 01:22:30,135
The store will be closing
in five minutes.

1349
01:22:30,206 --> 01:22:31,935
We wish you all
a merry Christmas,

1350
01:22:32,008 --> 01:22:35,239
a happy Hanukkah,
and a joyous Kwanzaa.

1351
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:53,895
All right, hold it steady.

1352
01:22:57,500 --> 01:23:00,469
Oh, yeah, shit, let's do it.

1353
01:23:01,470 --> 01:23:02,835
Oh, Christ.

1354
01:23:07,977 --> 01:23:08,966
Merry Christmas.

1355
01:23:10,513 --> 01:23:11,912
Good night.

1356
01:23:13,182 --> 01:23:15,241
Merry Christmas, Willie.

1357
01:23:15,318 --> 01:23:16,945
Up your ass.

1358
01:23:43,779 --> 01:23:45,508
Aaaah!

1359
01:23:48,484 --> 01:23:49,883
Whoa!

1360
01:24:16,312 --> 01:24:17,745
Oh, shit.

1361
01:24:19,015 --> 01:24:20,073
What?

1362
01:24:24,186 --> 01:24:25,483
What?

1363
01:24:25,554 --> 01:24:27,647
It's a Kitnerboy Redoubt.

1364
01:24:27,723 --> 01:24:28,417
So?

1365
01:24:28,491 --> 01:24:29,719
Remember Andy Pitz?

1366
01:24:29,792 --> 01:24:31,089
Andy Pitzorella?
Yeah.

1367
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:32,320
No, Andy Ripitski.

1368
01:24:32,395 --> 01:24:34,260
Andy Pitzorella
was Andy Blue Balls.

1369
01:24:34,330 --> 01:24:36,560
Since he got married,
they call him Andy Pitzorella.

1370
01:24:36,632 --> 01:24:38,395
What's your fucking point?!

1371
01:24:38,467 --> 01:24:40,162
They say he can get
into anything.

1372
01:24:40,236 --> 01:24:42,170
Anything.

1373
01:24:42,238 --> 01:24:44,536
They say he's been
in Margaret Thatcher's pussy.

1374
01:24:44,607 --> 01:24:45,972
<i>And that's a good thing?</i>

1375
01:24:46,042 --> 01:24:47,703
So what the fuck
are you getting at?

1376
01:24:47,777 --> 01:24:49,267
When I was
in the joint with him,

1377
01:24:49,345 --> 01:24:53,008
he told me that the Kitnerboy
Redoubt can't be cracked.

1378
01:24:53,082 --> 01:24:55,915
Are you shittin' me?

1379
01:24:55,985 --> 01:24:58,476
Are you telling me
that after I propped you up,

1380
01:24:58,554 --> 01:25:01,250
held you together,
smiled for all those kids,

1381
01:25:01,324 --> 01:25:03,519
danced for all those
fucking housewives

1382
01:25:03,592 --> 01:25:06,823
in a fucking lime-green,
fucking velvet elf costume,

1383
01:25:06,896 --> 01:25:09,023
that you cannot
get in this fucking safe?!

1384
01:25:09,098 --> 01:25:11,794
Is that what you're
telling me?! Huh?!

1385
01:25:11,867 --> 01:25:15,633
No, I'm just saying
it's gonna take a minute.

1386
01:25:39,028 --> 01:25:40,620
Fuck.

1387
01:25:50,940 --> 01:25:51,964
Shit.

1388
01:25:52,041 --> 01:25:53,736
34C.

1389
01:26:38,354 --> 01:26:39,514
Fuck!

1390
01:27:12,555 --> 01:27:14,216
Piece of cake.

1391
01:27:15,891 --> 01:27:18,621
I gotta get one more thing.
I'll be right back.

1392
01:27:41,851 --> 01:27:44,183
Oh, shit.
Which one did he say?

1393
01:28:02,805 --> 01:28:05,603
I'll bet the store dick
don't want this.

1394
01:28:05,674 --> 01:28:08,040
Store dick don't want shit.

1395
01:28:10,546 --> 01:28:12,514
What do you mean?

1396
01:28:12,581 --> 01:28:14,446
Store dick's dead.

1397
01:28:14,517 --> 01:28:16,985
Store dick don't want shit.

1398
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:20,151
He's dead, huh?

1399
01:28:22,591 --> 01:28:24,855
I didn't even know he was sick.

1400
01:28:24,927 --> 01:28:26,451
Willie...

1401
01:28:26,529 --> 01:28:28,997
this has been
a long time coming.

1402
01:28:29,064 --> 01:28:33,000
Every year, you're worse.
Every year, less reliable.

1403
01:28:33,068 --> 01:28:35,468
More booze.
More bullshit.

1404
01:28:35,538 --> 01:28:37,005
More buttfucking.

1405
01:28:37,072 --> 01:28:40,405
Sure, the three B's.

1406
01:28:40,476 --> 01:28:43,070
You gotta be able to rely,
Willie.

1407
01:28:45,748 --> 01:28:48,239
You people are monsters.

1408
01:28:48,317 --> 01:28:50,649
There's no joy in this for me.

1409
01:28:54,156 --> 01:28:56,351
I'm not talking about
you taking me out.

1410
01:28:56,425 --> 01:28:58,325
That part, I get.

1411
01:29:01,964 --> 01:29:03,795
But look at all that shit.

1412
01:29:06,168 --> 01:29:09,137
Do you really need
all that shit?

1413
01:29:10,806 --> 01:29:12,933
For Christ sakes,
it's Christmas.

1414
01:29:13,008 --> 01:29:14,669
It is Christmas, Willie.

1415
01:29:14,743 --> 01:29:16,301
But this is what we do.

1416
01:29:16,378 --> 01:29:18,608
We get the shit.

1417
01:29:18,681 --> 01:29:21,809
Christmastime, we get the shit.

1418
01:29:21,884 --> 01:29:25,047
Because we are men and Lois.

1419
01:29:27,590 --> 01:29:29,217
It is Christmas, Willie.

1420
01:29:29,291 --> 01:29:31,350
And we are men and Lois.

1421
01:29:32,861 --> 01:29:34,692
What you waiting for, honey?

1422
01:29:34,763 --> 01:29:37,732
Come on, plug him.

1423
01:29:41,637 --> 01:29:43,537
Goodbye, Willie.

1424
01:29:45,874 --> 01:29:47,398
- Drop the gun.
- Huh?!

1425
01:29:48,711 --> 01:29:50,736
And you, Santa,
drop the elephant.

1426
01:29:50,813 --> 01:29:52,713
- Where did you come from?
- Tipped off.

1427
01:29:52,781 --> 01:29:54,476
Shit, that fucking kid.

1428
01:29:54,550 --> 01:29:57,348
All three of you are in so much
shit, it's almost unbelievable.

1429
01:29:58,787 --> 01:30:00,652
Marcus, hop on!

1430
01:30:20,876 --> 01:30:22,969
Fuck me.

1431
01:30:57,212 --> 01:30:58,372
Hey, hey!

1432
01:31:19,568 --> 01:31:23,026
This is Christmas, and the kid's
getting his fucking present.

1433
01:31:46,929 --> 01:31:49,625
Halt, police!
Put your hands up!

1434
01:31:49,698 --> 01:31:52,292
I said freeze!
Freeze!

1435
01:31:58,874 --> 01:32:02,674
- Aaaah!
- Aaaah!

1436
01:32:45,954 --> 01:32:47,888
<i>"Dear kid...</i>

1437
01:32:47,956 --> 01:32:49,685
<i>I hope that you got my present</i>

1438
01:32:49,758 --> 01:32:52,056
<i>and that there wasn't
too much blood on it,</i>

1439
01:32:52,127 --> 01:32:54,527
<i>although there was blood
on the present you gave me,</i>

1440
01:32:54,596 --> 01:32:56,359
<i>which didn't keep me
from enjoying it.</i>

1441
01:32:56,431 --> 01:32:59,491
<i>So maybe the blood doesn't
matter so much, I guess. "</i>

1442
01:33:01,737 --> 01:33:04,831
<i>"Anyway, just in case
they took it as evidence,</i>

1443
01:33:04,907 --> 01:33:07,239
<i>I'm also sending you a T-shirt.</i>

1444
01:33:07,309 --> 01:33:09,800
<i>I hope it's the right size. "</i>

1445
01:33:10,445 --> 01:33:11,844
<i>"I'm healing up good,</i>

1446
01:33:11,914 --> 01:33:14,678
<i>and they tell me
that I will soon be 100%,</i>

1447
01:33:14,750 --> 01:33:16,615
<i>even with 8 bullets
dug out of me,</i>

1448
01:33:16,685 --> 01:33:18,710
<i>because they didn't hit
any vital organs,</i>

1449
01:33:18,787 --> 01:33:21,449
<i>just my liver,
which is fucked anyway.</i>

1450
01:33:21,523 --> 01:33:23,184
<i>Ha ha ha.</i>

1451
01:33:23,258 --> 01:33:25,453
<i>Thank you for giving
that letter to the cops.</i>

1452
01:33:25,527 --> 01:33:28,291
<i>I forgot I asked you to do it,
but it's a good thing you did</i>

1453
01:33:28,363 --> 01:33:30,797
<i>or Santa's little helper
would've plugged his ass.</i>

1454
01:33:30,866 --> 01:33:32,163
<i>Now the cops know I wrote it,</i>

1455
01:33:32,234 --> 01:33:34,202
<i>which is gonna keep my ass
out of jail.</i>

1456
01:33:34,269 --> 01:33:35,759
<i>That, plus everyone agreeing</i>

1457
01:33:35,838 --> 01:33:38,363
<i>that the Phoenix police
shooting an unarmed Santa</i>

1458
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:41,000
<i>was even more fucked up
than Rodney King. "</i>

1459
01:33:42,010 --> 01:33:44,308
<i>"The cops are treating me
like fucking royalty now,</i>

1460
01:33:44,379 --> 01:33:45,937
<i>which is new in my experience.</i>

1461
01:33:46,014 --> 01:33:48,005
<i>They're gonna make me
a sensitivity counselor</i>

1462
01:33:48,083 --> 01:33:49,448
<i>so that tragedies like this</i>

1463
01:33:49,518 --> 01:33:52,385
<i>will never again embarrass
the whole fucking department.</i>

1464
01:33:52,454 --> 01:33:55,480
<i>I told the cops you had no one
to take the fuck care of you,</i>

1465
01:33:55,557 --> 01:33:57,752
<i>so they set it up
with Mrs. Santa's sister</i>

1466
01:33:57,826 --> 01:33:59,316
<i>watching you
till your dad gets back</i>

1467
01:33:59,394 --> 01:34:00,827
<i>in one year and three months.</i>

1468
01:34:00,896 --> 01:34:03,831
<i>They made her a guardian
pro tem or some such shit.</i>

1469
01:34:03,899 --> 01:34:07,130
<i>Anyway, she seems to like you
and your house and Jacuzzi.</i>

1470
01:34:07,202 --> 01:34:08,430
<i>I sent her some money,</i>

1471
01:34:08,503 --> 01:34:09,902
<i>so if you play
your cards right,</i>

1472
01:34:09,972 --> 01:34:13,135
<i>you can probably get her
to buy you something.</i>

1473
01:34:13,208 --> 01:34:15,642
<i>As for my little helper,
I'm sorry to have to tell you</i>

1474
01:34:15,711 --> 01:34:17,906
<i>that him and his
prune-faced, mail-order wife</i>

1475
01:34:17,980 --> 01:34:20,244
<i>are gonna be exploring
mountains with your dad.</i>

1476
01:34:20,315 --> 01:34:22,613
<i>I hope your dad doesn't go
sucking shit from them</i>

1477
01:34:22,684 --> 01:34:23,912
<i>like I did.</i>

1478
01:34:23,986 --> 01:34:26,750
<i>They're supposed to let me
out of this hospital room soon,</i>

1479
01:34:26,822 --> 01:34:28,915
<i>so get some sandwiches ready.</i>

1480
01:34:28,991 --> 01:34:32,085
<i>Until then, don't take
no shit from nobody,</i>

1481
01:34:32,160 --> 01:34:33,752
<i>least of all yourself.</i>

1482
01:34:33,829 --> 01:34:35,888
<i>Ho ho ho.</i>

1483
01:34:35,964 --> 01:34:38,728
<i>Your pal, Santa. "</i>

1484
01:34:41,703 --> 01:34:42,829
Hey, loser.

1485
01:34:44,506 --> 01:34:47,873
I hear your buddy's not here
to protect you anymore.

1486
01:34:49,544 --> 01:34:51,774
See you got me a new bike.

1487
01:34:51,847 --> 01:34:53,610
Thanks a lot.

1488
01:34:54,283 --> 01:34:56,012
I'm talking to you, fat-ass!

1489
01:34:56,084 --> 01:34:57,813
Aaah!

1490
01:37:14,456 --> 01:37:17,050
<i>And it wouldn't be Christmas
without you</i>

1491
01:37:17,125 --> 01:37:19,423
<i>Can't fool me,
I know it's true</i>

1492
01:37:19,494 --> 01:37:23,760

1496
01:37:33,475 --> 01:37:35,773
<i>Making my friends
out of snow</i>

1497
01:37:35,844 --> 01:37:38,210
<i>It's Christmas,
and I'm all alone</i>

1498
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:40,339
<i>But it won't bring me down</i>

1499
01:37:40,415 --> 01:37:45,011
<i>'Cause Christmas cheer
is all around</i>

1500
01:37:45,087 --> 01:37:47,647

<i>Merry Christmas,

1506
01:38:03,972 --> 01:38:08,671
<i>Santa Claus is flying high
across the frosty winter sky</i>

1507
01:38:08,743 --> 01:38:11,007
<i>I'm gonna find him
and my toys</i>

1508
01:38:11,079 --> 01:38:15,448
<i>He's in a band
that just makes noise</i>

1509
01:38:15,517 --> 01:38:18,077
<i>And it wouldn't be Christmas

<i>Christmas</i>

<i>The snow's coming down</i>

1517

<i>Christmas</i>

1518
01:38:48,183 --> 01:38:50,174
<i>I'm watching it fall</i>

1519
01:38:50,252 --> 01:38:51,241
<i>Christmas</i>

1520
01:38:51,319 --> 01:38:53,514
<i>Watching the people around</i>

01:38:53,588 --> 01:38:54,555
<i>Christmas</i>

1522

Christmas at all</i>

1525

<i>I remember
when you were here</i>

1526
01:39:07,502 --> 01:39:10,562
<i>And all the fun
we had last year</i>

1527
01:39:10,639 --> 01:39:13,870
<i>- Baby, please come home
- Christmas</i>

1528
01:39:13,942 --> 01:39:17,241
<i>- Ohhhhh
- Christmas</i>

1529
01:39:17,312 --> 01:39:20,713
