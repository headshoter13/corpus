1
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:07,627
A big typhoon is brewing...

2
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:14,138
...south of the Ryukyu Islands,
heading northeast at 25 mile per hour.

3
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,746
We're ready, sir!

4
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,142
Off you go!

5
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:23,577
Let's go!

6
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:49,034
The storm is coming.

7
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:58,609
Typhoon 13 is heading north
and rapidly gaining strength.

8
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:02,812
It'll soon hit Boso Peninsula.

9
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:09,887
Here in Tateyama, it's raining
in torrents and the wind is fierce.

10
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:13,863
We can hardly stand up.

11
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:17,396
Weather Central reports...

12
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:23,975
...the typhoon has
an air pressure of 959 millibars.

13
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:27,045
The velocity...

14
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:32,246
The velocity of its wind
is 38 meters.

15
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:35,216
It's moving fast...

16
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,165
Oh, no!

17
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,215
Bad timing.

18
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:07,006
My house!

19
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,259
All troops, gather around Route 89.

20
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:29,766
Concentrate your firepower
and stop the beast.

21
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:51,820
Lock on target!

22
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:53,515
Fire!

23
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:27,421
The U.S. Navy Fifth Squadron
is moving toward Misawa.

24
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:30,153
Third and Fourth Maser Gun Units.

25
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,215
Maser, be ready!

26
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:04,418
What the...?

27
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,236
Raise turrets!

28
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,470
Link with target system!

29
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:21,135
Fire!

30
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,214
Fire maser!

31
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:45,464
The rain has reduced its power
to 70 percent.

32
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:13,188
Pull back!

33
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:36,412
Tateyama after a nightmare.

34
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:39,050
The damage is shocking.

35
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:43,450
Residents are totally despondent.

36
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:47,684
Army troops are pursuing
their rescue operation.

37
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,193
Premier Tsuge identified
the giant monster...

38
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:57,098
...as another Godzilla.
The first one raided us in 1954.

39
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:01,864
The new Godzilla inflicted
heavy damage on Tateyama...

40
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:06,034
...and disappeared in the Pacific.

41
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:10,171
It might still be hiding near us.

42
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:12,579
Forty-five years after the first one...

43
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:19,055
...how can we cope with the new one
that has raided us?

44
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:40,811
Forty-five years ago, in 1954,
the first Godzilla hit Tokyo.

45
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:46,816
It was killed with a device
invented by Dr. Serizawa.

46
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:00,960
But it can never be used again.

47
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:07,561
Dr. Serizawa feared its power
and sealed its secret...

48
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,733
...with his own death.

49
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:16,179
That Godzilla.

50
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:19,147
After its appearance...

51
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:23,118
...giant monsters have often raided us.

52
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:32,494
And then there was Mothra,
a giant moth from the South Pacific.

53
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:36,726
We invented a heat-ray gun
to use against it.

54
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:44,141
Our battle with Bigfoot Gaira
enabled us...

55
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:50,842
...to organize a troop to combat
monsters with maser guns.

56
00:10:55,988 --> 00:11:01,255
Each time, Tokyo was rebuilt
after the devastation...

57
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:07,856
...thanks to the efforts
of diligent citizens.

58
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:13,371
But Godzilla...

59
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:16,833
There's no monster like that.

60
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:22,008
Now it's back in Japan again.

61
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:26,413
What can we do?

62
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:34,419
We're not blaming you.

63
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:40,554
You will not be held responsible
for unintentional deaths in battle.

64
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:45,168
We want to know why it happened.

65
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:51,207
Why did a genius operator like you
miss the 73-type vehicle?

66
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:55,775
Panicked in terror?

67
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:02,085
I'm ready for any punishment.

68
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:23,542
Akane has been transferred
to Data Room.

69
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:35,381
In fact, let alone other monsters...

70
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:40,287
...maser guns can't injure Godzilla.

71
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:45,323
That must be the consensus.

72
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,864
I understand.

73
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:50,797
But we can't let anyone die in vain.

74
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:55,600
Too many have fallen victim
to Godzilla.

75
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:01,140
What's this? It looks like a monster.

76
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:03,611
You must know.

77
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:10,018
Trilobite. A species that became
extinct 245 million years ago.

78
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,020
A robot?

79
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,182
Half-robot.

80
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,089
The exterior is a robot.

81
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:20,221
I used horseshoe-crab
muscles and nerves.

82
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:26,861
It's controlled by DNA computers,
so it moves as if it were alive.

83
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:31,339
I want to conserve species,
even life forms like this...

84
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:37,813
...especially when human beings
are devastating the planet.

85
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:41,214
That's my mission.

86
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,414
Nobody's listening.

87
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,338
Mr. Yuhara?

88
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,807
I'm from the government.

89
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:09,880
Would you please come with us?

90
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,486
They're here.

91
00:14:54,627 --> 00:15:00,122
Here are Japan's greatest scientific
minds from various fields.

92
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:05,236
They should be called
the brain of our country.

93
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:10,164
I'd like to show you something.

94
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,490
Godzilla bones.

95
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:54,647
Bones of the Godzilla
that raided Japan in 1954.

96
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,221
They were found off Boso Peninsula.

97
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:03,123
Can you extract
an inter-spinal cell from them?

98
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:09,030
It won't be easy.

99
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:12,193
You want a Godzilla clone?

100
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:14,168
Not exactly.

101
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:20,575
We're going to make something
called a bio-robot.

102
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:26,783
It'll be a powerful weapon
against Godzilla.

103
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:31,150
A mechanical Godzilla
to beat Godzilla.

104
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:37,994
We need your cooperation
on this project.

105
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:41,758
This is a request
from the government.

106
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,078
The special bill on production...

107
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:59,013
...of an anti-Godzilla super-weapon
has passed through the Diet.

108
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,846
Where will the money come from?

109
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,318
Our pockets?

110
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:04,854
No more taxes!

111
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,551
We're meeting a crisis. Realize it.

112
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:11,855
We might use the weapon
on other occasions too.

113
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,465
It's Japan's rearmament.

114
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:16,260
The world is worried.

115
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,699
I'll convince them.

116
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:23,137
I'm ready to visit
any country to do so.

117
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:27,341
Japan was raided by Godzilla twice.

118
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:31,210
I'll tell them
how the victims suffered.

119
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,943
That's my responsibility.

120
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,984
You like this job?

121
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:40,890
You can relax here.

122
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,052
It'll suit you.

123
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:51,936
We're trying our best
to make the weapon.

124
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:57,805
It'll finish Godzilla, absolutely!

125
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:05,545
Good morning.

126
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,414
Sara, toast.

127
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,221
The number of supporters grew.

128
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:20,422
Seventy-seven percent.

129
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,591
Opposition blamed the government
for the speedy passage...

130
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,703
...of the Anti-Godzilla Weapon Bill.

131
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:32,208
But public opinion is supporting
the government more than before.

132
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:35,608
What do you think about it?

133
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:39,046
It means the terror of Godzilla...

134
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:43,621
...is spreading in the minds
of the people.

135
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:49,519
Dad, won't you take this job?

136
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,326
No.

137
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:53,658
Why not?

138
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:55,732
You know...

139
00:18:55,901 --> 00:19:01,100
...the most important thing for me
is to keep you company.

140
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:04,640
You have many problems.
You need me.

141
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,370
No, I don't.

142
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:10,674
Don't say I'm in your way.

143
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:14,949
I've got an idea!

144
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,384
A baseball star...

145
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:23,722
...sign a contract on the condition
that his child can enter the dugout.

146
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,793
How about that?

147
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:31,026
Baseball is one thing.
My job is another.

148
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:32,465
Eat your vegetables.

149
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:35,004
Mind the nutritional balance.

150
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:36,663
What about you?

151
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,367
I hate vegetables.

152
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,608
We have a visitor.

153
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:45,944
Eat quickly. Don't be late.

154
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:49,818
Would you please reconsider?

155
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:52,456
Didn't I refuse it?

156
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:57,561
Yes, you did,
but I have a new proposition.

157
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:01,790
Like the ballplayer whose child
can enter the dugout.

158
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:05,459
Can't you accept it?

159
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:16,541
You live near here?

160
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:20,048
She's new. Be nice to her.

161
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,052
They're making a robot here.

162
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,055
It's going to beat Godzilla.

163
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,422
What's its name?

164
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:33,964
A mechanical Godzilla,
so Mechagodzilla.

165
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:36,100
Mechagodzilla!

166
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:38,236
That's nice!

167
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,930
I live here. Goodbye.

168
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,642
I'm back.

169
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:51,273
Welcome home.

170
00:20:58,223 --> 00:20:59,815
Wonderful!

171
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:04,622
The Godzilla cells began to divide.

172
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:09,593
Our project is now on course.

173
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:25,108
Why Godzilla?

174
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:29,784
I wish they'd bring Mom back
to life, not a monster.

175
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:20,769
The nation needs strong leadership.

176
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:24,306
New prime minister.

177
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:41,917
How are you?

178
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,149
I'm the leader of Squadron Kiryu.

179
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:51,428
Kiryu?

180
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:57,525
That is the name of
the anti-Godzilla robot.

181
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:00,698
Mechagodzilla.

182
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:06,007
We'll have the best pilots and crew.

183
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:10,644
You're on the list too.

184
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:17,283
Three and a half years
is a long time.

185
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:35,362
Squadron Kiryu, halt!

186
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,675
Right turn!

187
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:42,304
Salute!

188
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:52,322
Squadron Kiryu, led by
Colonel Togashi...

189
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,517
...to start operational training.

190
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:11,674
This must be a mistake.

191
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:14,539
Why are you here?

192
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:19,383
Godzilla killed my brother,
but who caused it?

193
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:28,591
Stop it!

194
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,853
Be careful, men!

195
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:34,556
Don't let her kill us
like my brother.

196
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:40,099
Hayama! I'm the leader.

197
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:43,472
Any complaints?

198
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:48,204
Even if you're a good pilot...

199
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,372
...if you are going to upset
our teamwork, get out!

200
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:57,978
Anything else?

201
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,320
Hello.

202
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:14,355
Sleeping grass?

203
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:19,994
It moves when touched.

204
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:24,105
Coffee.

205
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:30,605
Here you are.

206
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:31,908
The same.

207
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,141
Hello.

208
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,843
Wolf!

209
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:38,081
Shut up!

210
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,255
May I sit here?

211
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:47,261
Akane... I mean, Miss Yashiro.

212
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:53,030
Would you like to have kids?

213
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:57,640
Well, maybe I'm too rash.

214
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:03,006
I hear the leader chose you
to pilot Kiryu.

215
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:07,545
That means you're the best pilot.

216
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:10,711
What does he see in you?

217
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:14,325
This project is doomed.

218
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:19,525
You seem to have many old fans.

219
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:22,189
Are you emitting pheromone?

220
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,232
The insult!

221
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:26,199
Beat it!

222
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:33,600
Hayama, you're going too far.

223
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,513
I see.

224
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:43,882
That explains his hostility.

225
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:48,489
I felt something odd about you.

226
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:52,892
A wall between you and the others.

227
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,965
You're isolated.

228
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:59,398
You still keep it?

229
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:00,936
Like her mother.

230
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:03,199
Dad!

231
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:08,873
I had one before.

232
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:11,880
I had no friends.

233
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:19,156
No family. I'm alone in the world.

234
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:25,458
So I got used to isolation.
It doesn't bother me.

235
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:30,094
Okay, let's make a bet.

236
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:35,836
If Mechagodzilla...
I mean, if Kiryu beats Godzilla...

237
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:38,669
...l'll treat you to dinner
in celebration.

238
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:42,802
But if Godzilla overcomes Kiryu...

239
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:46,549
...the maker owes you an apology.

240
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:51,655
So I'll treat you to dinner.
Is it a deal?

241
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:03,125
I was little when I had the plant.

242
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:07,801
Don't keep it forever.

243
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:33,662
Kiryu, the anti-Godzilla weapon
our country desperately needs...

244
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,665
...is now complete.

245
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:41,829
I thank the people who rendered
their service in its construction.

246
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:47,342
It's my greatest pleasure...

247
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,140
...to report it to the world today.

248
00:30:55,019 --> 00:31:00,286
I'll explain its structure
and performance.

249
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:08,462
As you know, the form
is based on Godzilla.

250
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:12,125
In terms of robotics, it's superb.

251
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:16,831
A perfect form for combat,
the best possible form.

252
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:21,411
DNA computers are used
for its transmit system.

253
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:25,481
In a usual computer,
only zero and one are used.

254
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:28,517
DNA has four types of bases.

255
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:31,712
They make speedy calculation
possible.

256
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:43,690
It's remote-controlled
from the transport.

257
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:49,696
What's this?

258
00:31:49,874 --> 00:31:50,863
A whale?

259
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:53,135
No!

260
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:57,579
Calling for scramble!

261
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:03,278
A monster in the Pacific!
Go get it immediately!

262
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:03,588
Kiryu can be in action for two hours.

263
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:07,786
Kiryu can be in action for two hours.

264
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:13,829
For longer periods, energy is sent
from a nearby Defense Force base...

265
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:18,731
...to a transport on location.

266
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,673
Kiryu is equipped with a weapon...

267
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:28,642
...called the Absolute-Zero Gun.
It's very powerful.

268
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:34,310
We tested it last week. Look.

269
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:40,117
Absolute zero means
273.15 degrees below zero.

270
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,953
It emits light
of very low temperature.

271
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:48,326
It smashed the atoms of the target.

272
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:20,221
It consumes 40 percent of the energy.
Kiryu, it's the ultimate weapon.

273
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:25,193
Something is moving on the sea.
It's not a ship.

274
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:35,102
What? Godzilla?

275
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:40,182
It's going north,
heading for Tokyo Bay.

276
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:47,253
Dispatch the Defense Forces
and Kiryu immediately.

277
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:58,267
Kiryu is under the control
of the AMF chief of staff.

278
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,768
It will leave immediately!

279
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:04,264
Godzilla...

280
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:29,523
White Herons 1, 2 and 3,
move to lift-off position!

281
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:37,932
Barriers off!

282
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:40,035
Lift-off okay.

283
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:42,679
A request from the U.S. Army!

284
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:44,974
Wait here.

285
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:47,310
White Herons ready!

286
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,776
Lift off!

287
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:54,455
White Heron 2.

288
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:22,712
Ground crew, pull back to safety!

289
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:26,220
Body-lock away.

290
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,498
Transport wire arms down!

291
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,194
Kiryu's body is up.

292
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:06,125
The coast is clear.

293
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:08,527
Body-balancer normal.

294
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:11,031
White Herons in level flight.

295
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:26,282
Godzilla has entered Tokyo Bay,
heading north for Tokyo.

296
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:30,853
Yokosuka, Yokohama
and Kawasaki are in danger.

297
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,785
Evacuate them.

298
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:36,085
All main roads are blocked.

299
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,387
Don't use your cars.

300
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:43,691
What are you waiting for?
Get moving!

301
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:56,410
Attention! Godzilla is coming!
Get out!

302
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:58,378
Gather round!

303
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,289
No time!

304
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:16,899
Get out of here!

305
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:20,299
An evacuation order
has been issued!

306
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:24,464
Visitors to Hakkejima Sea Paradise...

307
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:28,271
...evacuate the place
with the soldiers!

308
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:33,679
Take your children to safety!

309
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:46,460
Godzilla is here!

310
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:53,830
Get out!

311
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:55,996
Run!

312
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:17,460
Kiryu has arrived at the location.

313
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:20,461
Troops, be ready to attack.

314
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,065
Can Kiryu stop it?

315
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,808
Target spotted. Go down!

316
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,880
Roger, I'm going down.

317
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:40,040
Hakkejima has been evacuated.

318
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,324
Kiryu landed.

319
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:02,438
Leave Kiryu's range of action and wait!

320
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,678
Wire retracted.

321
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:12,680
White Heron 3 leaving the range.

322
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:19,346
Attack!

323
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:20,547
Roger!

324
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,251
Rockets away!

325
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:32,560
Missiles away!

326
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:41,604
Use the maser guns.

327
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:43,337
Roger!

328
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:04,735
It's retreating!

329
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,893
Akane, finish it!

330
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:10,473
Absolute-Zero, stand by.

331
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:30,953
Locks off.

332
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,060
What's happening?

333
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:39,202
There is no reaction!

334
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:46,704
Something's wrong with the system.

335
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:49,708
Not now!

336
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,352
Godzilla's leaving.

337
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:10,856
Akane, how's Kiryu?

338
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:13,069
Unable to operate.

339
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:15,501
Okay. Take it to the dock.

340
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:17,334
Roger.

341
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:28,879
What's that? You want to kill us?

342
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:30,418
What's going on?

343
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:31,816
It was Kiryu's idea!

344
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:07,416
It's running wild!

345
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:26,273
As if it were Godzilla!

346
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,938
Remain where you are...

347
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:32,548
...and wait for an order to attack.

348
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,650
Where's Squadron Kiryu?

349
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:39,453
I'll attract its attention
and lure it to the sea.

350
00:42:39,623 --> 00:42:40,749
Can you?

351
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:42,825
Leave it to me.

352
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,745
Damn it! Just follow me!

353
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:30,099
White Heron 3 shot down!

354
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:39,973
You okay?

355
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:42,175
Hayama!

356
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,947
Come on!

357
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:56,498
Go ahead! Hurry!

358
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:22,086
Why save me?

359
00:44:28,932 --> 00:44:31,765
It was not an error in the system.

360
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:34,495
I see! Kiryu recognizes its enemy.

361
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:37,334
It might use the Absolute-Zero.

362
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:40,270
Is there any way to stop Kiryu?

363
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:45,378
Wait until it consumes
all its energy.

364
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:46,914
How long?

365
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:51,417
About an hour.

366
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,005
Where's Godzilla?

367
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:30,552
We're desperately
searching for it, but...

368
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:44,097
I'll assume responsibility
for this failure.

369
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:48,102
I pushed the project.

370
00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:51,139
Will you resign?

371
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:56,905
We're trying hard to fix Kiryu.
Won't we need it?

372
00:46:58,081 --> 00:47:00,174
Squadron Kiryu?

373
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:02,079
I can't say now.

374
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:07,656
Kiryu was made from
the bones of Godzilla.

375
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:11,625
Is that why it calls in Godzilla?

376
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:23,701
The circuit joint is okay.

377
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:30,479
Something made it mad.

378
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:33,480
What, I wonder?

379
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:50,364
Give me your data.

380
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,297
Okay.

381
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:12,749
Godzilla roared at that moment.

382
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:16,552
Godzilla's roar disturbed
Mechagodzilla's system.

383
00:48:22,966 --> 00:48:24,991
Can Kiryu be fixed?

384
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,067
Sure.

385
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:33,608
We used Godzilla's DNA for Kiryu's
DNA computers, so it was adaptable.

386
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:37,645
If we change the base
to a different type...

387
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:40,578
...and make different
DNA computers...

388
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:44,517
...Kiryu won't be bothered by Godzilla.

389
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:46,918
That's good.

390
00:48:47,858 --> 00:48:51,988
But Mechagodzilla
will have no chance.

391
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:55,494
No.

392
00:48:56,366 --> 00:49:00,200
Only Kiryu can beat Godzilla.

393
00:49:01,805 --> 00:49:07,243
Anyway, I'll do my best for you, Akane.

394
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:11,941
I talk too much.

395
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:19,112
I'm glad the injury wasn't serious.

396
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:21,917
Who asked you to do it?

397
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:24,026
Do I owe you my life?

398
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:26,389
How disgusting!

399
00:49:26,563 --> 00:49:28,690
Why blame her?

400
00:49:28,865 --> 00:49:32,198
She saved our lives.

401
00:49:50,687 --> 00:49:53,850
So you're on her side now?

402
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:56,390
Listen.

403
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:00,121
Who's your enemy,
Akane or Godzilla?

404
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:03,425
No storm in a teacup.

405
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:13,172
Where's Sara?

406
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:32,219
Sara, what are you doing?

407
00:50:33,296 --> 00:50:36,732
Kiryu has a life too.

408
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:42,470
Why must it fight Godzilla
when they should be friends?

409
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:44,072
It thinks so.

410
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:51,944
The H-bomb first brought
Godzilla here.

411
00:50:52,115 --> 00:50:55,482
And now a Godzilla-like robot
brought him.

412
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:58,719
Who's to blame? Human beings.

413
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:06,252
I know what you mean, but...

414
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:08,398
You don't!

415
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:14,970
Adults say life is important,
but they don't believe it.

416
00:51:15,138 --> 00:51:19,666
No one pities Kiryu,
though it has a life too.

417
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:22,977
Sara.

418
00:51:26,983 --> 00:51:29,781
She's eccentric.

419
00:51:29,953 --> 00:51:34,083
Her mother died when Sara was 4.

420
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:37,693
She fell ill while she was pregnant.

421
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:43,697
The doctor said he could save
either the mother or the fetus.

422
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:48,201
I asked the doctor to save my wife.

423
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:52,671
But she wished her baby to be born.

424
00:51:53,743 --> 00:51:58,771
Sara wanted both her mother
and the baby to be safe.

425
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:03,785
In the end, both of them
went to heaven.

426
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,190
Since then...

427
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:14,592
...Sara has been sensitive
about life and death.

428
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:34,248
Talking with your mother again?

429
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,577
It's none of your concern.

430
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:43,520
Escaping from reality?

431
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:50,391
You must go onward,
even if you're afraid.

432
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:54,697
What's that?
Don't push that on me.

433
00:52:55,705 --> 00:52:59,971
You must fight and fight for your chair.

434
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:02,168
I've done so.

435
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:05,576
Fight against whom?

436
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:08,445
The whole world.

437
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:15,719
Well, certainly Kiryu is alive.

438
00:53:15,892 --> 00:53:20,022
But it's like me. Its life is worthless.

439
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:23,933
Is your life worthless?

440
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:29,636
Nobody was glad to have me.

441
00:53:29,806 --> 00:53:32,240
I shouldn't have been born.

442
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:34,536
Why not?

443
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:37,271
To be alive is good enough.

444
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:41,850
No life can be worthless.

445
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:48,319
It can't?

446
00:54:22,225 --> 00:54:24,455
Here's a report.

447
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:31,864
Is this Godzilla?

448
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:34,094
Maybe.

449
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:36,330
It's near us.

450
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:42,571
Godzilla is in Tokyo Bay
heading for Shinagawa.

451
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:45,476
It will land at 0100.

452
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:48,174
All troops, take positions!

453
00:55:21,851 --> 00:55:23,546
Godzilla is here!

454
00:55:34,297 --> 00:55:36,322
F2 Yellow 5 attacking!

455
00:56:51,174 --> 00:56:55,508
Godzilla has landed at Shinagawa.

456
00:56:55,678 --> 00:56:59,307
Kiryu's maintenance is done.
Report how it is.

457
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:01,313
Do a final check.

458
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,594
A big fire broke out in Shinagawa.

459
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,829
All troops, pull back!

460
00:57:23,006 --> 00:57:25,702
Kiryu has been repaired.

461
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,601
The scramble order?

462
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:31,774
Not yet.

463
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:34,348
No other weapons are useful.

464
00:57:34,517 --> 00:57:36,178
Why hesitate?

465
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:39,446
There will be more victims.

466
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:56,704
The chief of staff is waiting
at the Central Command Post.

467
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,868
The AMF chief of staff?

468
00:58:00,043 --> 00:58:03,342
In Kiryu's control room.

469
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:11,720
Yes?

470
00:58:11,888 --> 00:58:14,823
Your permission to dispatch Kiryu, sir.

471
00:58:19,028 --> 00:58:22,555
It's fully repaired.
It won't run wild again.

472
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:25,667
How can you be so sure?

473
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:28,998
The future of AMF depends on it.

474
00:58:29,806 --> 00:58:32,707
We all want it.

475
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:38,806
Togashi.

476
00:58:43,052 --> 00:58:45,782
Dispatch Kiryu.

477
00:58:46,656 --> 00:58:51,286
It's the only chance we have left.

478
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:52,951
It's my responsibility.

479
00:59:01,971 --> 00:59:03,939
I'll be waiting.

480
00:59:13,316 --> 00:59:16,376
The prime minister gave the okay!

481
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:19,784
Yes. I got the report just now.

482
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:21,787
I'll fly too.

483
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:23,892
Okay.

484
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:31,092
Dispatch Kiryu immediately!

485
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:22,846
Maybe I don't dislike her after all.

486
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,121
Here I come!

487
01:00:38,368 --> 01:00:41,166
I'm calling from Shinagawa Hospital.

488
01:00:41,337 --> 01:00:45,296
There are many patients to evacuate.

489
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,773
Send more cars.

490
01:00:47,944 --> 01:00:50,504
Godzilla!

491
01:00:55,885 --> 01:00:57,318
Godzilla's here!

492
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:00,217
Distance: 350.

493
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:06,223
It's going straight ahead.

494
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:08,023
SSM- 1, forward.

495
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:12,133
Godzilla is approaching
Shinagawa Hospital.

496
01:01:12,301 --> 01:01:14,428
Too late.

497
01:01:19,242 --> 01:01:21,802
Let go of Kiryu.

498
01:01:21,978 --> 01:01:23,036
You mean it?

499
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:24,679
Get ready!

500
01:01:45,635 --> 01:01:47,296
SSM-1, fire!

501
01:01:58,681 --> 01:02:00,478
SSM- 1 destroyed!

502
01:02:12,195 --> 01:02:13,253
Where are you going?!

503
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:18,598
Watch out!

504
01:02:19,936 --> 01:02:21,369
Down!

505
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:38,246
That one?

506
01:02:39,021 --> 01:02:41,080
That's Kiryu.

507
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:47,320
Come on!

508
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:49,124
Get in!

509
01:03:06,182 --> 01:03:08,343
Evacuation completed!

510
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,112
Go ahead, Kiryu!

511
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:13,277
Roger!

512
01:03:16,893 --> 01:03:18,451
Commence attack!

513
01:04:56,325 --> 01:04:58,088
What's the damage?

514
01:05:01,264 --> 01:05:03,391
It's okay.

515
01:05:43,339 --> 01:05:47,571
Atsugi Base, we're ready to take off.

516
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:34,213
Now, go!

517
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:43,760
Back-unit away!

518
01:07:08,124 --> 01:07:11,184
I'll show you what Kiryu can do.

519
01:07:38,287 --> 01:07:39,584
Good!

520
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:11,512
The Shinagawa and Minato areas
have been evacuated.

521
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:50,720
She did it!

522
01:08:52,895 --> 01:08:55,022
It can't fight much longer.

523
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:56,960
Its energy is depleting.

524
01:08:57,133 --> 01:09:01,729
There's only 45 percent
of its supply left.

525
01:09:01,904 --> 01:09:03,132
Finish it quickly.

526
01:09:06,208 --> 01:09:10,736
I understand.
Absolute-Zero stand by.

527
01:09:10,913 --> 01:09:13,143
Absolute-Zero stand by.

528
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:17,847
Lock off!

529
01:09:23,692 --> 01:09:25,387
Absolute-Zero away!

530
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:48,176
The buildings are gone!

531
01:09:50,252 --> 01:09:53,346
What are you doing? Stand up!

532
01:09:53,923 --> 01:09:57,381
- No! Kiryu won't respond!
- What?!

533
01:09:57,560 --> 01:10:01,894
Godzilla's heat ray damaged
Kiryu's control system.

534
01:10:02,064 --> 01:10:04,225
Fix it!

535
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:09,630
If the control system is damaged,
Kiryu can be manually operated...

536
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:12,433
...through one of the several
maintenance booths.

537
01:10:12,608 --> 01:10:13,666
That's it!

538
01:10:13,842 --> 01:10:15,571
It's too dangerous.

539
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:18,770
Godzilla's heat ray is radioactive.

540
01:10:18,948 --> 01:10:22,111
Let me do it!

541
01:10:22,284 --> 01:10:24,548
- I'm ready.
- No!

542
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:27,621
- I'll go!
- Wait, Akane!

543
01:10:28,123 --> 01:10:31,149
You have no permission to go! Wait!

544
01:10:40,536 --> 01:10:42,436
Take care.

545
01:10:46,442 --> 01:10:49,969
Don't let him beat you.

546
01:10:50,145 --> 01:10:53,842
Maser Gun Unit,
attract Godzilla's attention.

547
01:10:54,016 --> 01:10:55,313
The energy?

548
01:10:55,484 --> 01:10:58,612
We're short of electrical power.

549
01:10:58,787 --> 01:11:02,553
Can we get it from power companies?

550
01:11:02,725 --> 01:11:05,592
It we do, Tokyo will suffer
a blackout.

551
01:11:05,761 --> 01:11:06,750
Let's try.

552
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:11,961
Ask the power companies
immediately.

553
01:11:28,984 --> 01:11:31,009
Oh, no!

554
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:22,698
MB-3 is alive.

555
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:37,152
Okay, suspend the power supply.

556
01:12:37,152 --> 01:12:39,882
Okay, suspend the power supply.

557
01:12:40,055 --> 01:12:42,148
Areas 15 and 16, off.

558
01:12:42,324 --> 01:12:44,053
Areas 17 and 18, off.

559
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:01,900
Kiryu...

560
01:13:26,301 --> 01:13:28,565
Remove radioactivity.

561
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:30,227
Okay, Dr. Yuhara.

562
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:01,030
It's on!

563
01:14:02,771 --> 01:14:03,965
But the energy...

564
01:14:04,139 --> 01:14:05,606
We'll send it.

565
01:14:14,483 --> 01:14:17,543
Microwave the target.

566
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:18,811
Radiate!

567
01:14:31,066 --> 01:14:35,230
Kiryu, you understand what I say.

568
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:38,703
You and I are buddies.

569
01:14:40,275 --> 01:14:43,733
Shall we go?

570
01:14:46,348 --> 01:14:48,475
Okay, Kiryu is on!

571
01:14:55,457 --> 01:14:56,583
Behind you!

572
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:09,620
Don't die!

573
01:16:15,137 --> 01:16:17,833
Kiryu!

574
01:16:18,006 --> 01:16:19,803
Your power...

575
01:16:19,975 --> 01:16:22,443
Give me power!

576
01:16:25,213 --> 01:16:27,841
What's the damage? Report it!

577
01:16:28,016 --> 01:16:30,484
Come in! Answer me!

578
01:16:38,193 --> 01:16:40,093
Kiryu away!

579
01:16:41,396 --> 01:16:42,954
He is standing!

580
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:53,468
No! Not again!

581
01:17:10,325 --> 01:17:11,485
Godzilla!

582
01:17:27,676 --> 01:17:30,577
Godzilla can't spit fire now.

583
01:17:30,746 --> 01:17:33,772
Shoot the Absolute-Zero!

584
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:49,024
Never mind me! Shoot it!

585
01:17:49,197 --> 01:17:50,255
Hayama!

586
01:17:54,436 --> 01:17:55,835
Let's go!

587
01:19:28,463 --> 01:19:31,330
Godzilla has surfaced!

588
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:19,205
The Absolute-Zero is damaged.

589
01:20:19,381 --> 01:20:21,906
There is no energy left.

590
01:20:22,083 --> 01:20:24,677
Unable to follow Godzilla.

591
01:20:25,554 --> 01:20:27,818
Well done!

592
01:20:28,723 --> 01:20:31,749
Good job, Akane!

593
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:41,335
Send a unit to restore Kiryu.

594
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:47,207
We're coming to save you. Wait.

595
01:20:58,019 --> 01:21:01,011
We couldn't kill it.

596
01:21:01,189 --> 01:21:04,625
But we did expel Godzilla.

597
01:21:06,094 --> 01:21:12,329
We have a weapon more powerful
than Godzilla. That means a lot.

598
01:21:13,902 --> 01:21:17,133
We sacrificed plenty for it...

599
01:21:17,572 --> 01:21:20,939
...but it represents a great victory!

600
01:21:24,813 --> 01:21:27,247
Prime minister.

601
01:21:33,088 --> 01:21:36,387
Hishinuma. You did a great job!

602
01:21:57,579 --> 01:21:59,672
Sara?

603
01:21:59,848 --> 01:22:01,782
It's nothing.

604
01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:39,920
Repair crew, go to first deck.

605
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:55,467
Thank you.

606
01:26:55,643 --> 01:26:56,632
For what?

607
01:27:01,115 --> 01:27:04,016
You gave me strength.

608
01:27:05,253 --> 01:27:07,312
So did the others.

609
01:27:11,659 --> 01:27:14,958
No life is worthless.

610
01:27:15,129 --> 01:27:18,587
I believe you now.

611
01:27:23,805 --> 01:27:26,205
Where's the plant?

612
01:27:31,112 --> 01:27:34,013
Remember our bet?

613
01:27:34,182 --> 01:27:39,017
I owe you a celebration dinner.

614
01:27:39,887 --> 01:27:42,287
I didn't win.

615
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:45,757
It was a draw.

616
01:27:47,095 --> 01:27:51,498
In that case, I'll treat you to dinner.

617
01:27:59,741 --> 01:28:02,005
I did it!
