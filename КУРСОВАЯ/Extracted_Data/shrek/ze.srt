Today one of you shall prove himself--

270
00:22:38,021 --> 00:22:42,659
- 你想挨揍？ - 对不起
All right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. - Sorry about that. - [ Cheering ]

271
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:48,154
冠军将得到荣誉，不，特权
That champion shall have the honor-- no, no-- the privilege...

272
00:22:48,231 --> 00:22:52,292
去从龙严密的看守中
to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona...

273
00:22:52,335 --> 00:22:55,793
救出可爱的菲奥娜公主
from the fiery keep of the dragon.

274
00:22:55,839 --> 00:23:00,105
如果由于什么原因 冠军没有成功
If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful,

275
00:23:00,143 --> 00:23:03,306
亚军将接着去完成
the first runner-up will take his place...

276
00:23:03,346 --> 00:23:06,316
如此类推... 
and so on and so forth.

277
00:23:06,316 --> 00:23:12,048
你们中间有些人可能会死 但这是我愿意做出的牺牲
Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make.

278
00:23:14,825 --> 00:23:16,793
掌声


279
00:23:16,827 --> 00:23:19,295
比武现在开始！
Let the tournament begin!

280
00:23:24,935 --> 00:23:26,835
那是什么？
- What is that? - [ Gasping ]

281
00:23:28,305 --> 00:23:32,765
- 真丑死人了！ - 这可不怎么样
- It's hideous! - Ah, that's not very nice.

282
00:23:32,843 --> 00:23:38,481
- 不过是头驴 - 是啊，骑士们，新计划！
- It's just a donkey. - Huh? Indeed. Knights, new plan!

283
00:23:38,515 --> 00:23:43,214
杀死那个妖怪的人 将被授予冠军！进攻！
The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have at him!

284
00:23:43,286 --> 00:23:47,245
-抓住他！ - 现在，快！等等...
- Get him! - Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now.

285
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:49,656
去！抓住他！
[ Woman ] Go ahead! Get him!

286
00:23:49,693 --> 00:23:53,356
我们可以喝酒解决吗？
Can't we just settle this over a pint?

287
00:23:53,396 --> 00:23:59,269
- 杀死这个野兽！ - 不？那么，好吧
[ Man ] Kill the beast! No? All right then.

288
00:23:59,269 --> 00:24:01,464
来吧！
Come on!

289

300

308
00:25:24,955 --> 00:25:30,618
- 我可以下命令吗，先生？ - 不，我有个更好的主意
Shall I give the order, sir? No, I have a better idea.

309
00:25:30,927 --> 00:25:35,887
达罗克的人们 他就是我们的冠军！
People of DuLoc, I give you our champion!

310
00:25:35,932 --> 00:25:39,800
- 什么？ - 祝贺你，妖怪
- What? - Congratulations, ogre.

311
00:25:39,869 --> 00:25:44,272
你赢得了从事一个 伟大、高尚的探险荣誉
You've won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest.

312
00:25:44,307 --> 00:25:48,710
探求？我正在探求 寻求归还我的沼泽地
Quest? I'm already on a quest, a quest to get my swamp back.

313
00:25:48,745 --> 00:25:51,805
- 你的沼泽地？ - 对，我的沼泽地！
- Your swamp? - Yeah, my swamp!

314
00:25:51,848 --> 00:25:54,510
你把那些家伙扔在那里！
Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures!

315
00:25:55,619 --> 00:25:59,356
是的，妖怪，我们做个交易
- [ Crowd Murmuring ] - Indeed. All right, ogre, I'll make you a deal.

316
00:25:59,356 --> 00:26:03,292
你为我去探险 我就把沼泽地还给你
Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back.

317
00:26:03,326 --> 00:26:06,022
恢复原状？
Exactly the way it was?

318
00:26:06,062 --> 00:26:08,860
恢复到黏泥覆盖的原始模样
Down to the last slime-covered toadstool.

319
00:26:08,932 --> 00:26:12,265
- 那些擅自占据者呢？ - 全部搬走
- And the squatters? - As good as gone.

320
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:18,837
什么样的探险？
What kind of quest?

321
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:24,640
你要去跟龙作战 救出公主，然后回到沼泽地去
Let me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon... 

322
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:24,640
and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp...

323
00:26:24,681 --> 00:26:28,481
你现在没有沼泽地了 因为法阔德塞了些怪物进去
which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place.

324
00:26:28,518 --> 00:26:32,284
也许驴不会讲话是有道理的
- Is that about right? - Maybe there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk.

325
00:26:32,322 --> 00:26:35,849
你为什么不把你的魔力 都用在他身上？
I don't get it. Why don't you just pull some of that ogre stuff on him?

326
00:26:35,892 --> 00:26:37,860
包围他的堡垒
Throttle him, lay siege to his fortress,

327
00:26:37,894 --> 00:26:41,159
碾碎他的骨头夹面包吃 妖怪所有的本事
grind his bones to make your bread, the whole ogre trip.

328
00:26:41,197 --> 00:26:44,501
也许我可以砍掉全村人的头
Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have decapitated an entire village...

329
00:26:44,501 --> 00:26:47,299
把他们挂在长矛上
and put their heads on a pike,

330
00:26:47,337 --> 00:26:51,239
拿把刀，割开他们的脾 喝他们的脾液
gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and drink their fluids.

331
00:26:51,274 --> 00:26:55,971
- 你看怎么样？ - 不，真的，不怎么样
Does that sound good to you? Uh, no, not really, no.

332
00:26:55,979 --> 00:26:59,847
告诉你 妖怪比你想像的复杂
For your information, there's a lot more to ogres than people think.

333
00:26:59,883 --> 00:27:02,752
- 举个例子 - 例子？好...
- Example? - Example?

334
00:27:02,752 --> 00:27:07,090
妖怪就像洋葱
- Okay, um, ogres are like onions. 

335
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:11,261
- 它们辣臭？让你流泪？ - 不！
-  They stink?- Yes-- No! - They make you cry? - No!

336
00:27:11,261 --> 00:27:14,719
你把它们放在阳光下 它们都会变黄？
You leave them out in the sun, they get all brown, start sproutin' little white hairs.

337
00:27:14,764 --> 00:27:19,269
是层！洋葱有好多层
No! Layers! Onions have layers.

338
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:22,568
妖怪多层！洋葱多层
Ogres have layers! Onions have layers.

339
00:27:22,605 --> 00:27:25,165
你明白吗？我们都有好多层
You get it? We both have layers. [ Sighs ]

340
00:27:27,711 --> 00:27:34,084
你们都有好多层 可并不是人人都喜欢洋葱
Oh, you both have layers. Oh. [ Sniffs ] You know, not everybody likes onions.

341
00:27:34,084 --> 00:27:40,223
- 蛋糕！大家都喜欢蛋糕！ - 我不管...大家喜欢什么
Cake! Everybody loves cakes! Cakes have layers. I don't care... what everyone likes.

342
00:27:40,223 --> 00:27:43,954
妖怪不像蛋糕
Ogres are not like cakes.

343
00:27:46,763 --> 00:27:49,857
你知道大家还喜欢什么？冻糕
You know what else everybody likes? Parfaits.

344
00:27:49,899 --> 00:27:54,359
你从没听见一个人说 “不，我不喜欢冻糕？”
Have you ever met a person, you say, ''Let's get some parfait,'' they say, ''No, I don't like no parfait''?

345
00:27:54,404 --> 00:27:58,574
没有！你这个愚蠢讨厌的驴
- Parfaits are delicious. - No! You dense, irritating, miniature beast of burden!

346
00:27:58,575 --> 00:28:03,738
妖怪不像洋葱！行了吧 再见，回头见
Ogres are like onions! End of story. Bye-bye. See ya later.

347
00:28:08,351 --> 00:28:12,754
冻糕也许是这个星球上 最可口的东西
Parfaits may be the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet.

348
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:15,087
我想我宁愿听你哼歌
You know, I think I preferred your humming.

349
00:28:15,125 --> 00:28:18,458
你有餐巾纸吗？ 我这里一塌糊涂
Do you have a tissue or something? I'm making a mess.

350
00:28:18,495 --> 00:28:21,464
冻糕这个辞让我流口水了
Just the word parfait make me start slobbering.

351
00:28:25,301 --> 00:28:31,206

∮ I'm on my way from misery to happiness today ∮

352
00:28:31,274 --> 00:28:33,765

∮ Uh-huh, uh-huh Uh-huh, uh-huh ∮

353

∮ I'm on my way from misery to happiness today ∮

354

∮ Uh-huh, uh-huh Uh-huh, uh-huh ∮

355
00:28:41,951 --> 00:28:45,853

∮ And everything that you receive up yonder∮

356
00:28:45,955 --> 00:28:49,891

∮ Is what you give to me the day I wander∮

00:28:49,959 --> 00:28:52,894

∮ I'm on my way ∮

00:28:53,997 --> 00:28:56,898

∮ I'm on my way ∮∮

360
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:02,635
史莱克！是你干的吗？
Ooh! Shrek! Did you do that?

361
00:29:02,672 --> 00:29:06,438
你放屁之前得通知一声
You gotta warn somebody before you just crack one off. My mouth was open.

362
00:29:06,509 --> 00:29:09,945
相信我，驴 如果是我，你早就熏死了
Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead.

363
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:16,386
- 是硫磺石.我们一定快到了 - 对，硫磺石...
[ Sniffs ] It's brimstone. - We must be getting close. - Yeah, right, brimstone.

364
00:29:16,386 --> 00:29:20,117
别告诉我硫磺石 我知道我闻到了什么
Don't be talking about it's the brimstone. I know what I smell. It wasn't no brimstone.

365
00:29:20,156 --> 00:29:22,590
也没有什么石头
It didn't come off no stone neither.

366
00:29:40,543 --> 00:29:44,673
确实，够大的了 但看一下位置
Sure, it's big enough, but look at the location.

367
00:29:47,016 --> 00:29:52,477
史莱克？记得你说过 妖怪有好多层吗？
Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said ogres have layers?

368
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:57,460
我有点儿事要坦白
Well, I have a bit of a confession to make.

369
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:00,896
驴没有好多层 我们的恐惧都表现在袖子上
Donkeys don't have layers. We wear our fear right out there on our sleeves.

370
00:30:00,964 --> 00:30:05,060
- 等等！驴没有袖子 - 你明白我的意思
- Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves. - You know what I mean.

371
00:30:05,134 --> 00:30:07,932
你不能对我说你怕高
You can't tell me you're afraid of heights.

372
00:30:07,971 --> 00:30:12,499
在沸腾岩浆湖 摇晃的桥上走我不舒服
I'm just a little uncomfortable about being on a rickety bridge over a boiling lake of lava!

373
00:30:12,542 --> 00:30:19,382
别怕，驴，我就在你身边 帮助和鼓励你
Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside ya, okay? For emotional support,

374
00:30:19,382 --> 00:30:23,944
我们一起来通过 一次迈一婴儿小步
we'll just tackle this thing together one little baby step at a time.

375
00:30:23,987 --> 00:30:25,978
- 真的？ - 真的，真的
- Really? - Really, really.

376
00:30:26,022 --> 00:30:29,321
- 这样我感觉好多了 - 往前走
- Okay, that makes me feel so much better. -Just keep moving.

377
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:33,989
- 别往下看... - 别往下看，别往下看
- And don't look down. - Okay, don't look down. Don't look down.

378
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:37,431
别往下看，往前走 别往下看
Don't look down. Keep on moving. Don't look down.

379
00:30:37,567 --> 00:30:44,372
史莱克！我在往下看！ 我过不去了！请放了我吧！
Shrek! I'm lookin' down! Oh, God, I can't do this! Just let me off, please!

380
00:30:44,407 --> 00:30:47,934
- 你已经走了一半了！ - 我知道那部分安全！
- But you're already halfway. - But I know that half is safe!

381
00:30:47,977 --> 00:30:50,878
好，我没有时间，你回去吧
Okay, fine. I don't have time for this. You go back.

382
00:30:50,914 --> 00:30:53,382
史莱克！等等！
- Shrek, no! Wait! -Just, Donkey--

383
00:30:53,416 --> 00:30:56,476
- 我们交换一下儿位置 - 别这样！
- Let's have a dance then, shall we? - Don't do that!

384
00:30:57,553 --> 00:31:03,660
- 对不起，别哪样？这样？ - 对，那样
Oh, I'm sorry. Do what? - Oh, this? - Yes, that!

385
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:09,561
- 对？对，就这样，好 - 不，史莱克！
Yes? Yes, do it. Okay. [ Screams ] No, Shrek!

386
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:12,762
- 不！停下！ - 你说就这样！我在这样做啊
- No! Stop it! - You said do it! I'm doin' it.

387
00:31:12,802 --> 00:31:16,238
史莱克，我要死了，我要死了
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, I'm gonna die.

388
00:31:19,509 --> 00:31:22,000
这就行了，驴，这就行了
That'll do, Donkey. That'll do.

389
00:31:27,183 --> 00:31:29,413
酷
Cool.

390
00:31:29,452 --> 00:31:32,182
那么喷火的家伙在哪里？
[ Donkey ] So where is this fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway?

391
00:31:32,221 --> 00:31:34,985
在里面，等我们来救她
Inside, waiting for us to rescue her.

392
00:31:36,092 --> 00:31:38,822
我说的是龙，史莱克
[ Chuckles ] I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek.

393
00:31:55,011 --> 00:31:59,845
- 你怕吗？ - 不怕，但...
[ Donkey Whispering ] You afraid? No, but-- Shh.

394
00:31:59,849 --> 00:32:01,749
嗯，我也不怕
Oh, good. Me neither. [ Gasps ]

395
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,914
害怕并不是过错
'Cause there's nothin' wrong with bein' afraid.

396
00:32:06,956 --> 00:32:10,289
害怕是对陌生环境的敏感反应
Fear's a sensible response to an unfamiliar situation.

397
00:32:10,326 --> 00:32:15,123
陌生的危险环境 有一条喷火的龙
Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I might add. With a dragon 

398
00:32:12,724 --> 00:32:15,123
that breathes fire and eats knights and breathes fire,

399
00:32:15,131 --> 00:32:18,658
害怕并不意味着你是胆小鬼
it sure doesn't mean you're a coward if you're a little scared.

400
00:32:18,701 --> 00:32:21,602
我确信史莱克不是胆小鬼
I sure as heck ain't no coward. I know that. [ Gasps ]

401
00:32:23,072 --> 00:32:26,166
驴，两件事，好吗？
Donkey, two things, okay?

402
00:32:26,843 --> 00:32:31,614
闭嘴，去看看能不能找到楼梯
Shut... up. Now go over there and see if you can find any stairs.

403
00:32:31,614 --> 00:32:34,344
我以为我们在找公主
Stairs? I thought we was lookin' for the princess.

404
00:32:34,384 --> 00:32:38,878
她在楼上 在最高塔内最高的房间里
The princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest tower.

405
00:32:39,322 --> 00:32:42,917
- 你怎么知道她在那里？ - 我从书上看到的
- What makes you think she'll be there? - I read it in a book once.

406
00:32:42,992 --> 00:32:46,951
酷，你对付龙，我来对付楼梯
Cool. You handle the dragon. I'll handle the stairs.

407
00:32:46,996 --> 00:32:50,397
等我找到楼梯 我也要抽它们的屁股
I'll find those stairs. I'll whip their butt too.

408
00:32:50,433 --> 00:32:53,095
它们并不知道该去哪里
Those stairs won't know which way they're goin'.

409
00:32:56,806 --> 00:33:01,477
我要走难走的路 别打扰我，我是爬楼梯老手
I'm gonna take drastic steps. Kick it to the curb. Don't mess with me. I'm the stair master.

410
00:33:01,477 --> 00:33:06,141
我已经征服楼梯了 踏上一步就没有问题了
I've mastered the stairs. I wish I had a step right here. I'd step all over it.

411
00:33:09,052 --> 00:33:12,681
至少我们知道公主在哪里 但哪里...
Well, at least we know where the princess is, but where's the--

412
00:33:12,722 --> 00:33:14,952
龙？
Dragon! [ Screams ]

413
00:33:30,573 --> 00:33:32,302
驴，当心！
Donkey, look out! [ Screams ]

414
00:33:44,454 --> 00:33:46,445
抓住你了！
- Got ya! - [ Roars ]

415
00:34:22,291 --> 00:34:27,259
你的牙齿真大
No. Oh, no. No! [ Screams ] - Oh, what large teeth you have. - [ Growls ]

416
00:34:29,465 --> 00:34:33,299
我是说，闪亮的牙齿 你也许经常听人这么夸奖
I mean, white, sparkling teeth. I know you probably hear this all the time from your food,

417
00:34:33,336 --> 00:34:37,500
但你一定漂白了 因为你的笑很耀眼
but you must bleach, 'cause that is one dazzling smile you got there.

418
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:40,202
我闻到了，是薄荷味吗？
Do I detect a hint of minty freshness?

419
00:34:40,243 --> 00:34:44,976
你知道吗？你是条雌龙！
And you know what else? You're-- You're a girl dragon!

420
00:34:45,014 --> 00:34:49,508
当然！我是说，当然你是雌龙
Oh, sure! I mean, of course you're a girl dragon.

421
00:34:49,585 --> 00:34:53,385
你散发着女性的美
You're just reeking of feminine beauty.

422
00:34:53,422 --> 00:34:58,792
你怎么了？ 眼里掉进东西了？
What's the matter with you? You got something in your eye? Ooh. Oh. Oh.

423
00:34:58,794 --> 00:35:01,194
我真的愿意留下，但...
Man, I'd really love to stay, but, you know, I'm, uh-- [ Coughs ]

424
00:35:01,264 --> 00:35:05,257
我有气喘病 如果你吐烟圈我会受不了的
I'm an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd work out if you're gonna blow smoke rings.

425
00:35:07,403 --> 00:35:11,134
史莱克
No! Shrek! Shrek!

426
00:35:11,207 --> 00:35:13,072
史莱克
Shrek!

427
00:35:45,975 --> 00:35:47,806
- 醒醒！ - 什么？
- Wake up! - What?

428
00:35:47,843 --> 00:35:49,538
你是菲奥娜公主吗？
Are you Princess Fiona?

429
00:35:49,579 --> 00:35:54,915
是，我在等待 一个勇敢的骑士来救我
I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me.

430
00:35:54,951 --> 00:35:57,044
很好，我们走吧！
Oh, that's nice. Now let's go!

431
00:35:57,086 --> 00:36:01,457
等等，骑士先生 这是我们第一次见面
But wait, Sir Knight. This be-ith our first meeting.

432
00:36:01,457 --> 00:36:05,291
这不该是一个 非常浪漫的时刻吗？
Should it not be a wonderful, romantic moment?

433
00:36:05,328 --> 00:36:09,731
- 是，对不起，女士，没时间 - 你在干什么？
- Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time. - Hey, wait. What are you doing?

434
00:36:09,765 --> 00:36:11,858
你应该抱起我
You should sweep me off my feet...

435
00:36:11,968 --> 00:36:15,369
冲出远处的窗户 落在你勇敢的马上
out yonder window and down a rope onto your valiant steed.

436
00:36:15,404 --> 00:36:22,573
你有很多时间计划这些 是不是？
You've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you? Mm-hmm. [ Screams, Grunts ]

437
00:36:22,612 --> 00:36:28,351
但我们得品尝这个时刻！ 你该给我背段壮丽的诗
But we have to savor this moment! You could recite an epic poem for me.

438
00:36:28,351 --> 00:36:30,911
叙事史诗？十四行诗！
A ballad? A sonnet!

439
00:36:30,953 --> 00:36:34,252
- 五行打油诗？或是别的！ - 我并不这样认为
- A limerick? Or something! - I don't think so.

440
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:38,750
至少我该知道英雄的名字吧？
Can I at least know the name of my champion?

441
00:36:38,828 --> 00:36:40,762
史莱克
Um, Shrek.

442
00:36:40,763 --> 00:36:42,890
史莱克先生
Sir Shrek. [ Clears Throat ]

443
00:36:44,567 --> 00:36:49,300
我祈求你把这个手帕 当作我感谢的象征
I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude.

444
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,469
谢谢！
Thanks!

445
00:36:56,479 --> 00:37:00,883
- 你没有杀死龙？ - 这在我们的计划内，来！
You didn't slay the dragon? - It's on my to-do list. Now come on! - [ Screams ]

446
00:37:00,883 --> 00:37:03,511
但不该这样！
But this isn't right!

447
00:37:03,552 --> 00:37:08,081
你应该像其他骑士一样 在他们被烧死前
You were meant to charge in, sword drawn, banner flying. That's what all the other knights did.

448
00:37:08,124 --> 00:37:13,829
- 冲锋陷阵，挥剑拔刀 - 这不是问题所在
Yeah, right before they burst into flame. That's not the point. Oh!

449
00:37:13,829 --> 00:37:16,627
你去哪里？出口在那边儿
Wait. Where are you going? The exit's over there.

450
00:37:16,666 --> 00:37:22,036
- 我要救我的驴 - 你是什么骑士？
Well, I have to save my ass. What kind of knight are you?

451
00:37:22,071 --> 00:37:24,539
独一无二的骑士
One of a kind.

452
00:37:24,573 --> 00:37:26,905
慢点儿，慢点儿，宝贝儿
[ Donkey ] Slow down. Slow down, baby, please.

453
00:37:26,942 --> 00:37:31,242
时间久了才能全面了解一个人
I believe it's healthy to get to know someone over a long period of time.

454
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,908
就叫我老古板吧
Just call me old-fashioned. [ Laughs ]

455
00:37:33,949 --> 00:37:37,476
我不想仓促拥有肉体关系
I don't want to rush into a physical relationship.

456
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,047
我感情上还没有投入这...
I'm not emotionally ready for a commitment of, uh, this--

457
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:43,490
伟大是我要找的字
Magnitude really is the word I'm looking for.

458
00:37:43,526 --> 00:37:49,631
伟大，这是不想要的 肉体关系，你在干什么？
Magnitude-- Hey, that is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what are you doing?

459
00:37:49,632 --> 00:37:52,931
让我们回头一步一步地来
Okay, okay. Let's just back up a little and take this one step at a time.

460
00:37:52,968 --> 00:37:57,166
我们真的应该 先做个朋友或者笔友
We really should get to know each other first as friends or pen pals.

461
00:37:57,206 --> 00:38:01,438
我经常在路上旅行 但我喜欢接收明信片...
I'm on the road a lot, but I just love receiving cards--

462
00:38:01,477 --> 00:38:03,968
我确实想留下，但...
I'd really love to stay, but--

463
00:38:04,013 --> 00:38:06,641
别这样！这是我私人的尾巴
Don't do that! That's my tail! That's my personal tail.

464
00:38:06,682 --> 00:38:10,118
你要去掉？你要用它做什么？
You're gonna tear it off. I don't give permission-- What are you gonna do with that?

465
00:38:10,186 --> 00:38:14,020
现在！不行，不！
Hey, now. No way. No! No!

466
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:16,854
不！不！不！
No, no! No. No, no, no! No! Oh!

467
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:45,587
- 嗨，公主！ - 它会说话！
- Hi, Princess! - It talks!

468
00:38:45,654 --> 00:38:48,987
对，让他闭嘴得用窍门
Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's the trick.

469
00:39:24,894 --> 00:39:26,953
好，你们俩，朝出口前进！
Okay, you two, head for the exit!

470
00:39:28,697 --> 00:39:31,359
我来对付龙
I'll take care of the dragon.

471
00:39:37,273 --> 00:39:42,677
跑
Run!

472
00:40:24,253 --> 00:40:31,794
你成功了！你救了我！ 真令人惊叹，你...
- [ Dragon Growling In The Distance ] - You did it! You rescued me! You're amazing. You're--

473
00:40:31,794 --> 00:40:33,921
你太伟大了，你是...
You're wonderful. You're...

474
00:40:35,764 --> 00:40:38,062
我得承认，有点儿怪
a little unorthodox I'll admit.

475
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:42,730
但你的行为伟大，心底纯洁
But thy deed is great, and thine heart is pure.

476
00:40:43,372 --> 00:40:45,363
我将永远感激你
- I am eternally in your debt. - [ Clears Throat ]

477
00:40:47,042 --> 00:40:51,308
没有高贵的马 哪里有勇敢的骑士？
And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed?

478
00:40:51,413 --> 00:40:56,180
我希望你听到了这些话 她说我是高贵的马！
I hope you heard that. She called me a noble steed. She think I'm a steed.

479
00:40:56,252 --> 00:41:02,016
战斗打赢了 可以摘掉头盔了，好骑士先生
[ Fiona Laughs ] The battle is won. You may remove your helmet, good Sir Knight.

480
00:41:02,091 --> 00:41:06,962
- 为什么不？ - 我的头发被压扁了
- Uh, no. - Why not? I have helmet hair.

481
00:41:06,962 --> 00:41:10,227
求你，我想看看救我人的脸
Please. I would'st look upon the face of my rescuer.

482
00:41:10,266 --> 00:41:13,035
- 不，不，你不想... 
No, no, you wouldn't-- 'st.

483
00:41:13,035 --> 00:41:21,777
- 可你怎么吻我？ - 这不在工作的要求里 - 也许是个奖赏
But how will you kiss me? What? That wasn't in the job description. Maybe it's a perk.

484
00:41:21,777 --> 00:41:26,214
不，是命运 你一定要知道是怎么回事
No, it's destiny. Oh, you must know how it goes.

485
00:41:26,248 --> 00:41:30,082
一个被关在塔楼里 由龙看守的公主
A princess locked in a tower and beset by a dragon...

486
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:33,111
被一个勇敢的骑士搭救了
is rescued by a brave knight,

487
00:41:33,155 --> 00:41:37,182
然后他们分享了 真正爱人的第一个吻
and then they share true love's first kiss.

488
00:41:37,293 --> 00:41:41,964
和史莱克？你想...等等 你以为他是你真正的爱人？
Hmm? With Shrek? You think-- Wait. Wait. You think that Shrek is your true love?

489
00:41:41,964 --> 00:41:44,057
是啊！
Well, yes.

490
00:41:48,003 --> 00:41:52,573
- 史莱克是你真正的爱人！ - 这有什么好笑的？
You think Shrek is your true love! What is so funny?

491
00:41:52,608 --> 00:41:59,338
- 我不是你喜欢的那种 - 不，你是，你救了我
Let's just say I'm not your type, okay? Of course, you are. You're my rescuer.

492
00:42:00,082 --> 00:42:04,181
- 现在，摘掉你的头盔 - 这不是个好主意
Now-- Now remove your helmet. Look. I really don't think this is a good idea.

493
00:42:04,186 --> 00:42:06,245
- 就把头盔摘掉 - 不
-Just take off the helmet. - I'm not going to.

494
00:42:06,288 --> 00:42:09,625
-摘掉，现在！ - 好！
- Take it off. - No! - Now! - Okay!

495
00:42:09,625 --> 00:42:13,891
别发火，听从你的命令，阁下
Easy. As you command, Your Highness.

496
00:42:24,306 --> 00:42:27,742
你...你是个妖怪
You-- You're a--an ogre.

497
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:34,305
- 你以为我像王子一样漂亮？ - 嗯，对，是这样的
Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming. Well, yes, actually.

498
00:42:36,652 --> 00:42:41,887
不，都搞错了 你不应该是个妖怪
Oh, no. This is all wrong. You're not supposed to be an ogre.

499
00:42:42,891 --> 00:42:47,191
公主，我是被法阔德勋爵 派来救你的
[ Sighs ] Princess, I was sent to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay?

500
00:42:47,229 --> 00:42:51,200
- 是他想跟你结婚 - 那他为什么不来救我？
He's the one who wants to marry you. Then why didn't he come rescue me?

501
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,603
好问题，到那里后你去问他
Good question. You should ask him that when we get there.

502
00:42:55,704 --> 00:42:58,673
但我该被真正的爱人搭救
But I have to be rescued by my true love,

503
00:42:58,707 --> 00:43:01,574
而不是被妖怪和他的宠物搭救
not by some ogre and his-- his pet.

504
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:06,440
- 再也不是高贵的马了 - 你使我的工作更麻烦了
So much for noble steed. You're not making my job any easier.

505
00:43:06,448 --> 00:43:09,884
对不起 你的工作不是我的问题
I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem.

506
00:43:09,918 --> 00:43:15,151
你去告诉法阔德 如果他想体面地救我
You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he wants to rescue me properly,

507
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:17,658
我就在这里等他
I'll be waiting for him right here.

508
00:43:17,693 --> 00:43:22,721
我不是个送信的 我是个送货的
Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all right? I'm a delivery boy.

509
00:43:22,798 --> 00:43:27,169
- 你不敢，把我放下！ - 你来吗，驴？
You wouldn't dare. - Put me down! - Ya comin', Donkey?

510
00:43:27,169 --> 00:43:29,194
我就在你后面
I'm right behind ya.

511
00:43:29,271 --> 00:43:32,832
放下我，不然你将自食其果！
Put me down, or you will suffer the consequences!

512
00:43:32,875 --> 00:43:35,400
这太没有尊严了！放下我！
This is not dignified! Put me down! [ Screams ]

513
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,439
现在又有个问题
Okay, so here's another question.

514
00:43:40,516 --> 00:43:43,542
有个女人她喜欢你 但你不喜欢她
Say there's a woman that digs you, right, but you don't really like her that way.

515
00:43:43,585 --> 00:43:48,646
怎么才能容易地摆脱她 而不被她烧伤吃掉呢？
How do you let her down real easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't get burned to a crisp and eaten?

516
00:43:48,657 --> 00:43:51,285
就告诉她 她不是你真正爱的人
You just tell her she's not your true love.

517
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:54,227
当发现了真爱时 每个人都明白会...
Everyone knowest what happens when you find your--

518
00:43:56,932 --> 00:43:59,298
越早赶到达罗克越好
The sooner we get to DuLoc the better.

519
00:43:59,334 --> 00:44:02,269
你会喜欢那里的 那里很美丽！
You're gonna love it there, Princess. It's beautiful!

520
00:44:02,304 --> 00:44:06,104
我的未婚夫法阔德怎么样？ 他长得什么样？
And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad? What's he like?

521
00:44:06,175 --> 00:44:08,370
我这样来说吧，公主
Let me put it this way, Princess.

522
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:13,177
像法阔德那样矮的人很少
Men of Farquaad's stature are in short supply.

523
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:18,147
我不知道，有人很少瞧见他
I don't know. There are those who think little of him.

524
00:44:20,656 --> 00:44:23,557
停下，你俩都停下
Stop it. Stop it, both of you.

525
00:44:23,592 --> 00:44:28,689
你们是在嫉妒 你们没法跟法阔德勋爵比
You're just jealous you can never measure up to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.

526
00:44:28,731 --> 00:44:31,393
对，也许你说得对，公主
Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess.

527
00:44:31,433 --> 00:44:35,062
但明天见到他时 你最好亲自量量他
But I'll let you do the ''measuring'' when you see him tomorrow.

528
00:44:35,104 --> 00:44:38,835
明天？要等那么久啊？
Tomorrow? It'll take that long?

529
00:44:39,374 --> 00:44:44,141
- 我们停下露营吧？ - 不，那会更久
- Shouldn't we stop to make camp? - No, that'll take longer.

530
00:44:44,179 --> 00:44:48,616
- 我们接着走吧 - 但树林林里可能有强盗
- We can keep going. - But there's robbers in the woods.

531
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:52,086
停下！露营现在听起来不错！
Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camping's starting to sound good.

532
00:44:52,121 --> 00:44:56,251
我比这个森林里 任何的东西都更可怕
Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything we're going to see in this forest.

533
00:44:56,291 --> 00:44:58,725
我要找个地方露营！
I need to find somewhere to camp now!

534
00:45:05,467 --> 00:45:09,631
- 过来 - 可以找个更好的地方
- Hey! Over here. - Shrek, we can do better than that.

535
00:45:09,671 --> 00:45:12,299
这不适合公主
I don't think this is fit for a princess.

536
00:45:12,341 --> 00:45:15,242
很完美 再来几下家庭的润色就行了
No, no, it's perfect. It just needs a few homey touches.

537
00:45:15,277 --> 00:45:18,212
家庭的润色？像什么？
- Homey touches? Like what? - [ Crashing ]

538
00:45:20,249 --> 00:45:24,379
一扇门？先生，祝你们晚安
A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night.

539
00:45:24,419 --> 00:45:29,454
- 睡前我给你讲个故事吧？ - 我说过晚安！
You want me to read you a bedtime story? I will. I said good night!

540
00:45:32,027 --> 00:45:34,723
史莱克，你在干什么？
Shrek, what are you doing?

541
00:45:34,797 --> 00:45:39,693
我只...你知道...别担心 我只是开玩笑
[ Laughs ] I just-- You know-- Oh, come on. I was just kidding.

542
00:45:43,005 --> 00:45:48,206
那个，那是斯洛白克
[ Fire Crackling ] And, uh, that one, that's Throwback,

543
00:45:48,243 --> 00:45:52,043
惟一吐过三块麦地的妖怪
the only ogre to ever spit over three wheat fields.

544
00:45:52,114 --> 00:45:54,275
对，好
Right. Yeah.

545
00:45:55,651 --> 00:45:58,211
你能看星相说出我的未来吗？
Hey, can you tell my future from these stars?

546
00:45:58,253 --> 00:46:01,916
星相不能告诉我们未来 他们告诉我们故事
The stars don't tell the future, Donkey. They tell stories.

547
00:46:01,957 --> 00:46:05,393
瞧，布拉纳特臭气
Look, there's Bloodnut, the Flatulent.

548
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:09,328
- 你可以猜出它为什么出名 - 你在编造
- You can guess what he's famous for. - I know you're making this up.

549
00:46:09,364 --> 00:46:15,360
不，瞧，它在那里 猎人都臭跑了
No, look. There he is, and there's the group of hunters running away from his stench.

550
00:46:15,404 --> 00:46:18,931
它们只是群小星星
That ain't nothin' but a bunch of little dots.

551
00:46:19,007 --> 00:46:22,033
有时候事情 并不像表面上那么简单
Sometimes things are more than they appear.

552
00:46:24,313 --> 00:46:26,338
算了吧
Forget it.

553
00:46:29,484 --> 00:46:32,885
回到我们的沼泽地后 我们做什么？
Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway?

554
00:46:32,921 --> 00:46:36,983
- 我们的沼泽地？ - 我们救了公主
Our swamp? You know, when we're through rescuing the princess.

555
00:46:36,992 --> 00:46:41,793
我们？驴，没有“我们” 没有“我们的”
We? Donkey, there's no ''we.'' There's no ''our.''

556
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:43,855
那是我的沼泽地
There's just me and my swamp.

557
00:46:43,899 --> 00:46:48,461
我要做的第一件事 就是建个十英尺高的围墙
The first thing I'm gonna do is build a ten-foot wall around my land.

558
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:54,472
你伤害了我 你刚才深深地伤害了我
You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real deep just now.

559
00:46:54,509 --> 00:46:59,706
我想围墙只是为了堵人
You know what I think? I think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody out.

560
00:46:59,715 --> 00:47:02,240
不，你这么想？
- No, do ya think? 

561
00:47:02,851 --> 00:47:06,020
- 你在隐瞒什么？ - 没什么
- Are you hidin' something?Never mind, Donkey.

562
00:47:06,054 --> 00:47:09,490
这是另一个洋葱的问题 对不对？
Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn't it?

563
00:47:09,524 --> 00:47:13,153
不，这是个“别谈了”的问题
No, this is one of those drop-it and leave-it-alone things.

564
00:47:13,228 --> 00:47:16,994
- 你为什么不想谈呢？ - 你为什么想谈？
- Why don't you want to talk about it? - Why do you want to?

565
00:47:17,032 --> 00:47:18,897
- 你为什么要抑制自己？ - 我没有
- Why are you blocking? - I'm not blocking.

566
00:47:18,934 --> 00:47:21,232
- 你在抑制 - 我在警告你
- Oh, yes, you are. - Donkey, I'm warning you.

567
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:24,762
- 你想堵住谁？ - 每个人！行了吧？
- Who you trying to keep out? - Everyone! Okay?

568
00:47:26,108 --> 00:47:31,909
- 现在我们有所进展了 - 看在圣彼得的面上！
Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere. Oh! For the love of Pete!

569
00:47:31,947 --> 00:47:36,748
- 你对世界有什么不满？ - 不是我有不满
What's your problem? What you got against the whole world? I'm not the one with the problem, okay?

570
00:47:36,818 --> 00:47:39,753
世界看起来对我不满
It's the world that seems to have a problem with me.

571
00:47:39,788 --> 00:47:47,558
人们看我一眼说 “救命！一个大丑妖怪！”
People take one look at me and go, ''Aah! Help! Run! A big, stupid, ugly ogre!''

572
00:47:48,297 --> 00:47:53,834
他们不了解我就下了结论 这就是为什么我最好一个人
[ Sighs ] They judge me before they even know me. That's why I'm better off alone.

573
00:48:02,611 --> 00:48:04,046
你知道吗？我们见面时
You know what?

574
00:48:04,046 --> 00:48:09,846
我没有认为你是个大丑妖怪
When we met, I didn't think you was just a big, stupid, ugly ogre.

575
00:48:09,885 --> 00:48:16,224
- 对，我知道 - 那么，天上有驴吗？
Yeah, I know. So, uh, are there any donkeys up there?

576
00:48:16,224 --> 00:48:22,059
嗯，有个多嘴的驴 是个讨厌的小家伙
Well, there's, um, Gabby, the Small and Annoying.

577
00:48:22,064 --> 00:48:27,058
我看到了，一个闪亮的大家伙 就在那里，那边那个？
Okay, I see it now. The big shiny one, right there. That one there?

578
00:48:27,102 --> 00:48:29,593
- 那是月亮 - 啊，对
- That's the moon. - Oh, okay.

579
00:48:52,494 --> 00:48:54,894
再给我看看
[ Farquaad ] Again. Show me again.

580
00:48:58,667 --> 00:49:02,660
镜子，镜子，让我再看看她 让我再看看公主
Mirror, mirror, show her to me. Show me the princess.

581
00:49:06,875 --> 00:49:11,676
十全十美
Ah. Perfect. [ Inhales ]

582
00:50:15,577 --> 00:50:20,549
对，你知道我喜欢这样 宝贝儿，我说过就喜欢这样
Mmm,yeah,you know I like it like that. - Come on, baby. I said I like it. - Donkey, wake up.

583
00:50:20,549 --> 00:50:26,221
- 驴，醒醒 - 什么？
- Huh? What? - Wake up. - What? - Good morning.

584
00:50:26,221 --> 00:50:30,157
史莱克，你喜欢吃啥样的蛋？
How do you like your eggs?

585
00:50:30,225 --> 00:50:34,252
- 早安，公主！ - 这是怎么回事？
- Good morning, Princess! - What's all this about?

586
00:50:34,296 --> 00:50:38,323
我们昨天开始得不好
We kind of got off to a bad start yesterday.

587
00:50:38,366 --> 00:50:45,031
我想弥补一下儿 我是说，毕竟你救了我
I wanted to make it up to you. After all, you did rescue me.

588
00:50:45,974 --> 00:50:48,067
谢谢
- Uh, thanks. - [ Sniffs ]

589
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:52,012
吃吧，今天会很忙
Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead of us.

590
00:50:56,451 --> 00:51:03,125
什么？这是赞美 我总是说出气比进气好
- [ Belches ] - Shrek! What? It's a compliment. Better out than in, I always say. [ Laughs ]

591
00:51:03,125 --> 00:51:06,686
在公主面前不能这样
- Well, it's no way to behave in front of a princess. - [ Belches ]

592
00:51:06,728 --> 00:51:09,959
- 谢谢 - 她和你一样粗野
- Thanks. - She's as nasty as you are.

593
00:51:10,899 --> 00:51:14,835
你知道，你不像我想像的那样
[ Laughs ] You know, you're not exactly what I expected.

594
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:19,204
也许在不了解之前 不该下结论
Maybe you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them.

595
00:51:22,777 --> 00:51:25,143
解放了！
[ Man ] La liberte! Hey!

别动，我亲爱的 因为我是你的救星！

Look, pal, I don't know who you think you are!

00:57:01,783 --> 00:57:05,480
是，史莱克认为 法阔德在弥补什么
You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's compensating for something,

664
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,978
我想这意味着他有个...
which I think means he has a really-- Ow!

665
00:57:09,057 --> 00:57:14,720
- 我想我们最好上路吧 - 当然，但史莱克？
Um, I, uh-- - I guess we better move on. - Sure. But, Shrek?

666
00:57:14,796 --> 00:57:17,629
我担心驴
- I'm-- I'm worried about Donkey. - [ Blubbering ]

667
00:57:17,665 --> 00:57:20,031
- 什么？ - 我是说，你看他
- What? - I mean, look at him.

668
00:57:20,101 --> 00:57:23,127
- 他看起来很不好 - 什么？我很好！
- He doesn't look so good. - What are you talking about? I'm fine.

669
00:57:23,171 --> 00:57:27,164
他们总是这么说 然后他们就倒下了...
That's what they always say, and then next thing you know, you're on your back.

670
00:57:28,309 --> 00:57:31,437
- 死了 - 她说得对，你气色不好
- Dead. - You know, she's right.

671
00:57:31,479 --> 00:57:33,815
- 你想坐下歇会儿吗？ - 我来泡杯茶
You look awful. Do you want to sit down?

672
00:57:33,815 --> 00:57:36,618
我原来不想说，我的脖子刺痛
- I'll make you some tea. - I didn't want to say nothin',

673
00:57:36,618 --> 00:57:40,453
当我转动时，瞧？
but I got this twinge in my neck, and when I turn my head like this, look. - Ow! See?

674
00:57:40,522 --> 00:57:44,083
- 谁饿了？我去找饭 - 我去找柴火
-Who's hungry? I'll find us some dinner. -I'll get the firewood.

675
00:57:44,125 --> 00:57:48,585
你们去哪里？ 伙计，我感觉不到脚趾头了！
Hey, where you goin'? Oh, man, I can't feel my toes!

676
00:57:48,663 --> 00:57:53,631
我没有脚趾头了 谁来抱抱我？！
I don't have any toes! I think I need a hug.

677
00:57:59,974 --> 00:58:03,501
这个很好吃，真的
Mmm. This is good. This is really good.

678
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:10,174
- 这是什么？ - 草老鼠，是烧烤的
- What is this? - Uh, weedrat. Rotisserie style.

679
00:58:10,218 --> 00:58:16,915
- 说真的，还挺香的 - 炖着吃也很香
No kidding. Well, this is delicious. Well, they're also great in stews.

680
00:58:16,925 --> 00:58:22,022
我不是吹牛 我做的炖草鼠很出色
Now, I don't mean to brag, but I make a mean weedrat stew.

681
00:58:24,966 --> 00:58:29,062
我想明晚的饭菜会有点儿不同
[ Sighs ] I guess I'll be dining a little differently tomorrow night.

682
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:34,175
也许某天你可以来沼泽地看我
[ Gulps ] Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp sometime.

683
00:58:34,175 --> 00:58:36,541
我给你做各种饭菜
I'll cook all kinds of stuff for you.

684
00:58:36,578 --> 00:58:40,480
沼泽蛤蟆汤 生鱼眼饼，你就说吧...
Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare-- you name it.

685
00:58:40,548 --> 00:58:43,714
我会喜欢的
[ Chuckles ] I'd like that.

686
00:58:50,592 --> 00:58:53,823

? See the pyramids along the Nile ?

687
00:58:53,895 --> 00:59:00,291
- 公主？ - 什么，史莱克？
Um, Princess? -? Watch the sunrise from a tropic isle ? - Yes, Shrek?

688
00:59:01,169 --> 00:59:07,136
我在想...你...
- I, um, I was wondering. -?Just remember, darling all the while ? Are you--

689
00:59:07,208 --> 00:59:09,802

? You belong to me ??

690
00:59:09,877 --> 00:59:12,368
你会吃这些吗？
[ Sighs ] Are you gonna eat that?

691
00:59:19,454 --> 00:59:22,787
看着日落很浪漫，是不是？
- Man, isn't this romantic? Just look at that sunset. - Sunset?

692
00:59:22,824 --> 00:59:28,160
- 日落？不？我是说太晚了 - 什么？
Oh, no! I mean, it's late. - I-It's very late. - What?

693
00:59:28,229 --> 00:59:31,164
等等，我明白是怎么回事了
Wait a minute. I see what's goin' on here.

694
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:33,224
你怕黑吗？
- You're afraid of the dark, aren't you? - Yes!

695
00:59:33,267 --> 00:59:38,295
对，是这样！我怕黑 我最好进去
Yes, that's it. I'm terrified. You know, I'd better go inside.

696
00:59:38,373 --> 00:59:41,740
没什么，我以前也怕黑
Don't feel bad, Princess. I used to be afraid of the dark, too, until--

697
00:59:41,776 --> 00:59:44,540
不，等等！我仍旧怕黑
Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of the dark.

698
00:59:44,612 --> 00:59:50,909
- 晚安 - 晚安
- [ Shrek Sighs ] - Good night. Good night.

699
00:59:54,122 --> 00:59:58,892
- 我知道这里发生了什么事 - 你在说什么？
Now I really see what's goin' on here. Oh, what are you talkin' about?

700
00:59:58,893 --> 01:00:01,191
我是动物，我有直觉
I don't even wanna hear it. Look, I'm an animal, and I got instincts.

701
01:00:01,229 --> 01:00:03,925
我知道你俩互相爱慕
I know you two were diggin' on each other. I could feel it.

702
01:00:03,998 --> 01:00:07,161
你疯了 我只是把她带给法阔德
You're crazy. I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad.

703
01:00:07,201 --> 01:00:13,300
醒醒闻闻气味吧！ 去告诉她你对她的感觉
Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell the pheromones. -Just go on in and tell her how you feel. - I--

704
01:00:13,408 --> 01:00:17,572
没什么好说的 再说，就是我对她说了
There's nothing to tell. Besides, even if I did tell her that,

705
01:00:17,612 --> 01:00:22,884
你知道，我不是说我要去说 我不会去说的
well, you know-- and I'm not sayin' I do 'cause I don't--

706
01:00:22,884 --> 01:00:28,249
- 她是公主而我是... - 妖怪？
she's a princess, and I'm-- An ogre?

707
01:00:28,523 --> 01:00:31,014
对，一个妖怪
Yeah. An ogre.

708
01:00:31,059 --> 01:00:35,155
- 你去哪里？ - 再去...找些柴火
- Hey, where you goin'? - To get... more firewood.

709
01:00:54,582 --> 01:00:58,846
公主！菲奥娜公主？
Princess? Princess Fiona?

710
01:01:03,291 --> 01:01:05,225
公主，你在哪里？
Princess, where are you?

711
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:13,690
公主
Princess?

712
01:01:16,504 --> 01:01:19,564
这里怪可怕的 我不是在玩游戏
It's very spooky in here. I ain't playing no games.

713
01:01:30,485 --> 01:01:32,253
- 不，不！ - 不！救命！
- Aah! - Oh, no! - No, help!

714
01:01:32,253 --> 01:01:35,385
不，没事儿
- Shh! - Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! - No, it's okay. It's okay.

715
01:01:35,423 --> 01:01:38,586
- 公主在哪里？ - 我就是公主
- What did you do with the princess? - Donkey, I'm the princess.

716
01:01:38,626 --> 01:01:43,791
- 是我，在这个躯体里 - 天啊！你吃了公主！
- Aah! - It's me, in this body. Oh, my God! You ate the princess!

717
01:01:43,831 --> 01:01:48,200
你能听见吗？保持呼吸 我把你救出来！
- Can you hear me? - Donkey! - Listen, keep breathing! I'll get you out of there! - No!

718
01:01:48,269 --> 01:01:50,737
史莱克
- Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! - Shh.

719
01:01:50,838 --> 01:01:52,703
这就是我
- Shrek! - This is me.

720
01:01:57,779 --> 01:02:00,680
公主
Princess?

721
01:02:00,715 --> 01:02:06,278
你怎么了？你...变样了
What happened to you? You're, uh, uh, uh, different.

722
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:08,515
- 我变丑了，是吗？ - 是的！
- I'm ugly, okay? - Well, yeah!

723
01:02:08,556 --> 01:02:11,855
是因为你吃的东西？ 我知道不该吃那些老鼠
Was it something you ate? 'Cause I told Shrek those rats was a bad idea.

724
01:02:11,893 --> 01:02:14,453
- 我说是你吃的东西 - 不
- You are what you eat, I said. Now-- - No.

725
01:02:14,495 --> 01:02:17,896
我从记事起就一直这个样子
I-- I've been this way as long as I can remember.

726
01:02:17,932 --> 01:02:20,423
什么？我从没见过你这个样子
What do you mean? Look, I ain't never seen you like this before.

727
01:02:20,468 --> 01:02:23,665
日落后才会这样
It only happens when the sun goes down.

728
01:02:24,906 --> 01:02:30,645
白天一个样，晚上一个样 这是规律
''By night one way, by day another. ''This shall be the norm...

729
01:02:30,645 --> 01:02:38,552
直到得到真正爱人的初吻 然后变成他的模样
''until you find true love's first kiss... and then take love's true form.''

730
01:02:38,619 --> 01:02:42,180
真美，我不知道你会写诗
Ah, that's beautiful. I didn't know you wrote poetry.

731
01:02:42,223 --> 01:02:44,258
这是诅咒
It's a spell.

732
01:02:44,258 --> 01:02:49,626
我小的时候 一个巫婆诅咒了我
[ Sighs ] When I was a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me.

733
01:02:49,664 --> 01:02:55,963
每天晚上 我都会变成这个可怕的丑兽
Every night I become this. This horrible, ugly beast!

734
01:02:58,472 --> 01:03:03,500
我被放在塔中 等待真正的爱人来救我
I was placed in a tower to await the day my true love would rescue me.

735
01:03:03,578 --> 01:03:07,882
这就是为什么明天日落前 我得跟法阔德结婚
That's why I have to marry Lord Farquaad tomorrow... before the sun sets 

736
01:03:07,882 --> 01:03:13,921
在他见到我...像这样之前
and he sees me...like this. [ Sobs ]

737
01:03:13,988 --> 01:03:17,219
好，镇静，还不是太差
All right, all right. Calm down. Look, it's not that bad.

738
01:03:17,258 --> 01:03:21,524
我不会撒谎，你是丑 但不是太丑
You're not that ugly. Well, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly.

739
01:03:21,562 --> 01:03:24,895
而且你只是夜里丑 史莱克却时时如此
But you only look like this at night. Shrek's ugly 2 4-7.

740
01:03:24,932 --> 01:03:28,026
但，驴，我是位公主
But, Donkey, I'm a princess,

741
01:03:28,069 --> 01:03:31,232
公主不该是这个模样
and this is not how a princess is meant to look.

742
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:35,872
你不跟法兰德结婚，好吗？
Princess, how 'bout if you don't marry Farquaad?

743
01:03:35,943 --> 01:03:40,505
我不得不，只有真正爱人的吻 才能解除诅咒
I have to. Only my true love's kiss can break the spell.

744
01:03:40,548 --> 01:03:44,075
但，你...也算是个妖怪
But, you know, um, you're kind of an ogre,

745
01:03:44,118 --> 01:03:47,645
史莱克，嗯 你们有很多的共同点
and Shrek-- well, you got a lot in common.

746
01:03:47,688 --> 01:03:49,178
史莱克
Shrek?

747
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:53,090
公主，我... 首先，你好吗？
Princess, I-- Uh, how's it going, first of all?

748
01:03:53,127 --> 01:03:57,865
好？对，我也好，我很好
Good? Um, good for me too. I'm okay.

749
01:03:57,865 --> 01:04:02,928
我看到了这些花想到了你 因为花很漂亮...
I saw this flower and thought of you because it's pretty and--

750
01:04:03,004 --> 01:04:07,839
我不怎么喜欢，但我想 你可能会，因为你很漂亮
well, I don't really like it, but I thought you might like it 'cause you're pretty.

751
01:04:07,875 --> 01:04:09,900
但我仍很喜欢你，我...
But I like you anyway. I'd-- uh, uh--

752
01:04:12,747 --> 01:04:16,342
我遇到麻烦了，好，走吧
I'm in trouble. Okay, here we go.

753
01:04:16,384 --> 01:04:21,287
我不能随便嫁人的 看看我，驴
[ Fiona ] I can't just marry whoever I want. Take a good look at me, Donkey.

754
01:04:21,355 --> 01:04:26,156
我是说，真的 谁会爱一个可怕的丑八怪？
I mean, really, who could ever love a beast so hideous and ugly?

755
01:04:26,193 --> 01:04:28,559
公主和丑不相容
''Princess''and ''ugly'' don't go together.

756
01:04:28,596 --> 01:04:31,030
这就是为什么我不能 跟史莱克呆在一起的原因
- That's why I can't stay here with Shrek. - [ Gasps ]

757
01:04:31,065 --> 01:04:35,525
我惟一幸福生活的机会 就是跟我真正的爱人结婚
My only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love.

758
01:04:35,603 --> 01:04:42,405
你不明白吗，驴？ 我不得不这样做
- [ Deep Sigh ] - Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how it has to be.

759
01:04:42,476 --> 01:04:45,739
这是解除诅咒惟一的方法
It's the only way to break the spell.

760
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:48,044
你应该把真相告诉史莱克
- You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth. - No!

761
01:04:48,082 --> 01:04:51,415
不！你不能透露一个字 不能告诉任何人
You can't breathe a word. No one must ever know.

762
01:04:51,452 --> 01:04:56,856
- 如果要保密为什么告诉我？ - 你发誓不说，发誓！
What's the point of being able to talk if you gotta keep secrets? Promise you won't tell. Promise!

763
01:04:56,891 --> 01:04:59,985
好，我不说，但你应该说
All right, all right. I won't tell him. But you should.

764
01:05:00,027 --> 01:05:03,690
我知道在此结束之前 我需要接受治疗
I just know before this is over, I'm gonna need a whole lot of serious therapy.

765
01:05:03,731 --> 01:05:05,596
瞧我的眼在抽搐
- Look at my eye twitchin'. - [ Door Opens ]

766
01:05:29,390 --> 01:05:32,154
我告诉他，不告诉他
[ Fiona ] I tell him, I tell him not.

767
01:05:33,995 --> 01:05:39,627
我告诉他，不告诉他 我告诉他
I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him.

768
01:05:39,667 --> 01:05:41,760
史莱克
Shrek!

769
01:05:41,836 --> 01:05:47,464
史莱克，有件事...
Shrek, there's something I want-- [ Snoring ]

770
01:06:05,192 --> 01:06:07,387
史莱克
Shrek.

771
01:06:08,829 --> 01:06:12,933
- 你没事儿吧？ - 没事儿，空前良好
- Are you all right? - Perfect! Never been better.

772
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,328
有件事我得告诉你
I-- I don't-- There's something I have to tell you.

773
01:06:16,370 --> 01:06:20,574
你不必告诉我什么 昨晚我听得够多了！
You don't have to tell me anything, Princess. - I heard enough last night.

774
01:06:20,574 --> 01:06:23,134
- 你听到我的话了？ - 每一个字
- You heard what I said?Every word.

775
01:06:23,177 --> 01:06:25,372
我想你能理解
I thought you'd understand.

776
01:06:25,446 --> 01:06:31,078
我理解，就像你说的那样 谁会爱一个可怕的丑兽？
Oh, I understand. Like you said, ''Who could love a hideous, ugly beast?''

777
01:06:31,118 --> 01:06:33,814
我以为这对你不重要
But I thought that wouldn't matter to you.

778
01:06:33,854 --> 01:06:36,721
是吗？啊，很重要
Yeah? Well, it does.

779
01:06:38,192 --> 01:06:40,456
准时到达
- Ah, right on time. - [ Horse Whinnies ]

780
01:06:40,494 --> 01:06:44,089
公主，我给你带来个小东西
Princess, I've brought you a little something.

781
01:06:47,802 --> 01:06:50,532
我错过了什么？
[ Yawns ] What'd I miss? What'd I miss?

782
01:06:51,539 --> 01:06:54,201
是谁说的？不可能是驴
[ Muffled ] Who said that? Couldn't have been a donkey.

783
01:06:55,076 --> 01:07:00,775
- 菲奥娜公主 - 按照承诺，给我地契
Princess Fiona. As promised. Now hand it over.

784
01:07:00,815 --> 01:07:05,149
很好，妖怪，你沼泽地的契约 按照协议已经清除好了
Very well, ogre. The deed to your swamp, cleared out, as agreed.

785
01:07:05,186 --> 01:07:09,350
在我改变主意之前 拿着它走吧
Take it and go before I change my mind.

786
01:07:09,857 --> 01:07:14,694
原谅我，公主 让你吃惊了，但你让我吃惊
Forgive me, Princess, for startling you, but you startled me,

787
01:07:14,728 --> 01:07:18,459
我从没见过这么耀人的美
for I have never seen such a radiant beauty before.

788
01:07:18,499 --> 01:07:21,400
我是法阔德勋爵
I am Lord Farquaad.

789
01:07:21,602 --> 01:07:25,538
法阔德勋爵？不，不
Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no.

790
01:07:25,573 --> 01:07:28,609
请原谅，勋爵 我正要简短地...
- [ Snaps Fingers ] - Forgive me, my lord, for I was just saying...

791
01:07:28,609 --> 01:07:34,108
告别
a short... farewell.

792
01:07:34,148 --> 01:07:38,312
真优美 你不必对那个妖怪有礼貌
That is so sweet. You don't have to waste good manners on the ogre.

793
01:07:38,886 --> 01:07:44,847
- 它不懂什么感情 - 你说得对，它不懂
It's not like it has feelings. No, you're right. It doesn't.

794
01:07:44,925 --> 01:07:48,952
菲奥娜公主 美丽、洁白无无的菲奥娜
Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawless Fiona.

795
01:07:48,996 --> 01:07:52,056
我向你求婚

你愿意做完美新郎 完美的新娘吗？
Will you be the perfect bride for the perfect groom?

797
01:08:00,441 --> 01:08:05,640
法阔德勋爵，我愿意 没什么比...
Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would make--

798
01:08:05,679 --> 01:08:08,876
我来计划，我们明天结婚
Excellent! I'll start the plans, for tomorrow we wed!

799
01:08:08,916 --> 01:08:10,884
不！我是说...
No! I mean, uh,

800
01:08:11,919 --> 01:08:17,289
为什么要等？ 我们今天日落前结婚吧
why wait? Let's get married today before the sun sets.

801
01:08:17,324 --> 01:08:20,020
着急了，是吧？你说得对
Oh, anxious, are we? You're right.

802
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:22,858
越早越好，有很多事要做
The sooner, the better. There's so much to do!

803
01:08:24,131 --> 01:08:26,497
酒筵、乐队、客人名单
There's the caterer, the cake, the band, the guest list.

804

队长，列出客人名单！
Captain, round up some guests!

805
01:08:29,637 --> 01:08:32,128
再见，妖怪
[ Fiona ] Fare-thee-well, ogre.

806
01:08:32,173 --> 01:08:35,006
你在干什么？她要走了
Shrek, what are you doing? You're letting her get away.

807
01:08:35,042 --> 01:08:37,875
- 那又怎么样？ - 有件事你应该知道
- Yeah? So what? - Shrek, there's something about her you don't know.

808
01:08:37,912 --> 01:08:40,380
我昨晚跟她谈了，她...
Look, I talked to her last night. She's--

809
01:08:40,414 --> 01:08:44,441
我知道你昨晚跟她谈了 你们是好朋友，是不是？
I know you talked to her last night. You're great pals, aren't ya?

810
01:08:44,552 --> 01:08:48,318
如果你俩那么好 为什么不跟她回家？
Now, if you two are such good friends, why don't you follow her home?

811
01:08:48,355 --> 01:08:50,380
史莱克，我想跟着你
Shrek, I-- I wanna go with you.

812
01:08:50,424 --> 01:08:53,393
我说过，你不能跟我回家
I told you, didn't I? You're not coming home with me.

813
01:08:53,427 --> 01:08:59,591
我自己住！我的沼泽地！ 我！不要外人，明白吗？
I live alone! My swamp! Me! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody!

814
01:08:59,667 --> 01:09:04,570
特别不要无用、可怜 烦人、会说话的驴！
Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys!

815
01:09:04,605 --> 01:09:07,733
- 但，我想... - 啊，你知道吗？
- But I thought-- - Yeah. You know what?

816
01:09:07,775 --> 01:09:10,073
你的想法错了！
You thought wrong!

- What are you doing∮ I would think, of all people, you would recognize a wall when you see one.

850
01:11:41,628 --> 01:11:47,032
对，但墙应该围绕着 我的沼泽地，而不是通过
Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed to go around my swamp, not through it.

851
01:11:47,067 --> 01:11:49,970
是这样的，这是你的一半 这是我的一半
It is around your half. See, that's your half, and this is my half.

852
01:11:49,970 --> 01:11:55,008
一你的一半 一对，我帮你救了公主
Oh! Your half. Hmm. Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess.

853
01:11:55,008 --> 01:11:57,533
我干了一半的活儿 我得一半的战利品
I did half the work, I get half the booty.

854
01:11:57,578 --> 01:12:01,036
把那个大石头给我 像你脑袋的那个
Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks like your head.

855
01:12:01,081 --> 01:12:03,379
- 后退 - 不，你后退
- Back off! - No, you back off.

01:12:03,417 --> 01:12:05,408
- 这是我的沼泽地！ - 是我们的
- This is my swamp! - Our swamp.

- Stubborn jackass! - Smelly ogre.

859
01:12:09,256 --> 01:12:11,190
好！
Fine!

860
01:12:11,458 --> 01:12:13,585
回来，我还没说完呢
- Hey, come back here. I'm not through with you yet. - Well, I'm through with you.

861
01:12:13,627 --> 01:12:18,530
- 我已经跟你说完了 - 你总是“我，我，我！”
Uh-uh. You know, with you it's always, ''Me, me, me!''

862
01:12:18,565 --> 01:12:23,434
现在该轮到我了！ 闭上嘴听我说！
Well, guess what! Now it's my turn! So you just shut up and pay attention!

863
01:12:23,504 --> 01:12:28,100
你对我很刻薄 侮辱我，我做的事你不领情
You are mean to me. You insult me and you don't appreciate anything that I do!

864
01:12:28,142 --> 01:12:31,236
你总是摆布我，向外推我
You're always pushing me around or pushing me away.

865
01:12:31,278 --> 01:12:35,180
是吗？如果我对你这么不好 你为什么要回来？
Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back?

866
01:12:35,215 --> 01:12:38,446
因为我们是朋友！ 朋友互相原谅！
Because that's what friends do! They forgive each other!

867
01:12:38,519 --> 01:12:46,021
你说得对，驴 我原谅你背叛了我！
Oh, yeah. You're right, Donkey. I forgive you... for stabbin' me in the back!

868
01:12:46,093 --> 01:12:51,553
你把自己包了好几层 你害怕自己的感觉
Ohh! You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy, you're afraid of your own feelings.

869
01:12:51,598 --> 01:12:54,066
- 走开！ - 你又那么做了
- Go away! - There you are, doing it again just like you did to Fiona.

870
01:12:54,101 --> 01:12:57,764
就像对菲奥娜一样 她喜欢你，也许甚至爱你
All she ever do was like you, maybe even love you.

871
01:12:57,805 --> 01:13:01,969
爱我？她说我丑 是个可怕的动物
Love me? She said I was ugly, a hideous creature.

872
01:13:02,009 --> 01:13:04,000
我听到你俩的谈话
I heard the two of you talking.

873
01:13:04,044 --> 01:13:08,413
她不是说你，她是说别人
She wasn't talkin' about you. She was talkin' about, uh, somebody else.

874
01:13:10,918 --> 01:13:15,753
她不是说我？ 那她说的是谁？
She wasn't talking about me? Well, then who was she talking about?

875
01:13:15,789 --> 01:13:20,890
我不会说的 你不想听我说，对不对？
Uh-uh, no way. I ain't saying anything. You don't wanna listen to me. - Right? Right? - Donkey!

876
01:13:20,961 --> 01:13:25,523
- 不！ - 好，对不起，行了吧？
- No! - Okay, look. I'm sorry, all right?

877
01:13:27,134 --> 01:13:29,068



878
01:13:30,404 --> 01:13:38,339
对不起 我是个大笨蛋，丑八怪
[ Sighs ] I'm sorry. I guess I am just a big, stupid, ugly ogre.

879
01:13:39,079 --> 01:13:41,411
你能原谅我吗？
Can you forgive me?

880
01:13:43,717 --> 01:13:45,708
朋友就该这样
Hey, that's what friends are for, right?

881
01:13:45,752 --> 01:13:50,451
- 好，朋友？ - 朋友
Right. Friends? Friends.

882
01:13:51,191 --> 01:13:55,821
那...菲奥娜说我什么了？
So, um, what did Fiona say about me?

883
01:13:55,896 --> 01:13:59,059
你为什么问我？ 为什么不去问她？
What are you asking me for? Why don't you just go ask her?

884
01:13:59,099 --> 01:14:02,125
婚礼！我们来不及了
The wedding! We'll never make it in time.

885
01:14:02,169 --> 01:14:07,639
别怕，有志者，事竟成 我有办法
Ha-ha-ha! Never fear, for where there's a will, there's a way, and I have a way. [ Whistles ]

886
01:14:11,979 --> 01:14:14,447
驴
- Donkey?

887
01:14:14,515 --> 01:14:16,949
我想是我动物的魅力
I guess it's just my animal magnetism.

888
01:14:16,984 --> 01:14:20,150
你，过来
[ Laughing ] Aw, come here, you.

889
01:14:20,187 --> 01:14:23,054
别这样，没人喜欢拍驴屁的
All right, all right. Don't get all slobbery. No one likes a kiss ass.

890
01:14:23,090 --> 01:14:25,524
好，上来抓紧
All right, hop on and hold on tight.

891
01:14:25,559 --> 01:14:29,791
还没来得及安装安全带
I haven't had a chance to install the seat belts yet.

892
01:15:00,894 --> 01:15:02,759

我们国王的结合...
- to the union... - Um-- - of our new king-- - Excuse me.

896
01:15:11,505 --> 01:15:15,636
对不起 我们能不能跳到“我愿意”？
- Could we just skip ahead to the ''I do's''? - [ Chuckling ]

897
01:15:15,809 --> 01:15:17,674
继续
Go on.

走吧，高兴点儿 需要你时我会吹口哨儿的
Go ahead, have some fun. If we need you, I'll whistle. How about that?

899
01:15:28,422 --> 01:15:31,482
等一等！ 你要做那件事，对不对？
Shrek, wait, wait! Wait a minute!

900
01:15:31,558 --> 01:15:33,617
你在说什么？
- You wanna do this right, don't you? - What are you talking about?

901
01:15:33,694 --> 01:15:38,222
等待牧师说 “现在说否则永远保持沉默”
There's a line you gotta wait for. The preacher's gonna say, ''Speak now or forever hold your peace.''

902
01:15:38,298 --> 01:15:42,064
- 这时你说“我反对” - 我没时间听你说！
- That's when you say, ''I object!'' - I don't have time for this!

903
01:15:42,102 --> 01:15:45,868
- 听我说！你爱这个女人吗？ - 爱
Wait. What are you doing? Listen to me! - Look, you love this woman, don't you? - Yes.

904
01:15:45,906 --> 01:15:48,575
- 你想拉她的手，取悦她吗？ - 对
- You wanna hold her? - Yes. - Please her? - Yes!

905
01:15:48,575 --> 01:15:52,033
那么你得设法温柔点儿
y Then you got to, got to try a little tenderness yy

906
01:15:52,079 --> 01:15:57,117
- 女人都喜欢这种浪漫！ - 这个家伙什么时候说这句？
- The chicks love that romantic crap! - All right! Cut it out. 

907
01:15:54,598 --> 01:15:57,117
- When does this guy say the line? - We gotta check it out.

908
01:15:57,117 --> 01:16:02,578
- 我们得查一下儿 - 以我的权力...
- [ Donkey Grunting ] - And so, by the power vested in me,

909
01:16:02,623 --> 01:16:04,853
- 你看到什么了？ - 全城的人都在
-[ Shrek ] What do you see? - The whole town's in there.

910
01:16:04,925 --> 01:16:08,793
- 我宣布你们为夫妻... - 他们在圣坛上
- I now pronounce you husband and wife, - They're at the altar.

911
01:16:08,829 --> 01:16:11,229
- 国王和王后 - 他已经说了！
- king and queen. - Mother Fletcher! He already said it.

912
01:16:11,264 --> 01:16:13,789
看在圣彼得的份上！
- Oh, for the love of Pete! - [ Grunts ]

913
01:16:15,135 --> 01:16:17,194
我反对！
I object!

914
01:16:17,270 --> 01:16:21,365
他想干什么？
- Shrek? - [ Gasps ] Oh, now what does he want?

915
01:16:24,945 --> 01:16:28,005
大家好 你们很愉快，是不是？
Hi, everyone. Havin' a good time, are ya?

916
01:16:28,048 --> 01:16:32,917
- 我喜欢达罗克，很干净 - 你来这里干什么？
I love DuLoc, first of all. - Very clean. - What are you doing here?

917
01:16:32,953 --> 01:16:35,922
没人想要你时还活着 已经够无礼的了
Really, it's rude enough being alive when no one wants you,

918
01:16:35,956 --> 01:16:39,289
但不请自来参加婚礼...
-but showing up uninvited to a wedding-- -Fiona!

919
01:16:39,326 --> 01:16:42,352
- 我要跟你谈谈 - 现在你想谈谈？
- I need to talk to you. - Oh, now you wanna talk?

920
01:16:42,396 --> 01:16:45,456
有点儿晚了，请原谅...
It's a little late for that, so if you'll excuse me--

921
01:16:45,499 --> 01:16:47,933
- 但你不能跟他结婚 - 为什么？
- But you can't marry him. - And why not?

922
01:16:47,968 --> 01:16:51,904
因为他跟你结婚是为了当国王
Because-- Because he's just marrying you so he can be king.

923
01:16:51,938 --> 01:16:54,338
令人气愤！别听他的
Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him.

924
01:16:54,408 --> 01:16:58,037
- 他并不真正爱你 - 你懂爱吗？
- He's not your true love. - And what do you know about true love?

925
01:16:58,078 --> 01:17:03,948
- 嗯，我...我是说 - 这真是有意思极了！
Well, I-- Uh-- - I mean-- - Oh, this is precious.

926
01:17:04,017 --> 01:17:08,710
妖怪爱上了公主！

史莱克，这是真的吗？
Shrek, is this true?

菲奥娜，亲爱的 吻完后就会永远幸福，吻我！
Fiona, my love, we're but a kiss away from our ''happily ever after.'' Now kiss me! Mmmm!

932
01:17:35,582 --> 01:17:38,551
白天一个样，晚上一个样
''By night one way, by day another. ''

真恶心！卫兵！卫兵！

这不会改变什么 这个婚姻仍算数，我是国王！
This hocus-pocus alters nothing. This marriage is binding, and that makes me king!

938
01:18:26,666 --> 01:18:29,066
- 你瞧 - 不，放开我！
- See? See? - No, let go of me! Shrek!

- I am king! - [ Whistles ] I will have order! I will have perfection! I will have--

946
01:19:01,268 --> 01:19:06,229
不准动，我有龙 我会毫不犹豫使用他的
- Aah! - All right. Nobody move. I got a dragon here, and I'm not afraid to use it.

947
01:19:06,273 --> 01:19:09,666
我是头发怒的驴！
-[ Dragon Roars ] - I'm a donkey on the edge!

948
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:16,048
名人的婚姻，从没持久过
Celebrity marriages. They never last, do they?

949
01:19:18,151 --> 01:19:20,619
去啊，史莱克
Go ahead, Shrek.

950
01:19:21,354 --> 01:19:27,021
- 菲奥娜？ - 什么，史莱克？

- 真的，真的 - 我也爱你
Really, really. I love you too.

953
01:19:48,615 --> 01:19:55,217
直到你找到真正爱的初吻 变成真正爱的模样...
''Until you find true love's first kiss...  and then take love's true form. ''

954
01:20:18,812 --> 01:20:21,713



955

957
01:20:35,562 --> 01:20:40,158
- 你没事儿吧？ - 嗯，没事儿
Are you all right? Well, yes.

958
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:45,695
但我不明白，我应该漂亮
But I don't understand. I'm supposed to be beautiful.

959
