你就不會是那樣了。
Cammie, you can only be a tease
if you stop sleepin' around, babe.

401
00:27:07,521 --> 00:27:09,989
是喔，我會一直忘記那部分的。
Yeah. I keep forgetting that part.

我要一份龍舌蘭酒，
不要忘了也給你這小可愛一份。
I'll have a shot of tequila, and don't
forget one for your pretty little self.

403

喔，謝謝，但自從我因喝過那酒而真正
醉過一次後，我再也不碰那東西了。
Oh, thanks, but ever since I got really drunk
on tequila, I never drink the stuff anymore.

404

婉拒真正的好酒。
Hey, Lil! Your new girl's refusing
your good booze.

請我一份雙份的。
No! I was-- I was suggesting
this gentleman buy me a double.
