1
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,160
- Nothing over here?
- Move to the next one!

2
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,240
- Easy, easy!
- Any luck?

3
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,040
- We need more sap today.
- Look out below!

4
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,000
- Any luck?
- A little higher.

5
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,160
A little to the left!

6
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,000
We don't have all day. Hurry!

7
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,360
- I found some
- Good.

8
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,600
Hoist them up!

9
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,360
I got it.

10
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,480
Heads up. How was that?

11
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,800
- Not so good
- Yeah, same here

12
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,600
Hey, Enode!
Working hard?

13
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,800
What would you know about work?

14
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Always off playing.

15
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,600
I do not play, Enode. I explore.

16
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,000
A waste of time.

17
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,600
Our only duty is to serve the gods,
Kaena.

18
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,600
They protect us.

19
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,600
Come on, hurry up.
We'll be late for the offering.

20
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,480
Protect us!
They're not doing such a great job.

21
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,680
Here they come!

22
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,800
The monster.

23
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,000
It steals our sap and keeps us
thirsty.

24
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,600
It has turned our planet into a
wasteland.

25
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,240
My queen, these attacks are
killing us.

26
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,480
Our world is dying.

27
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,680
You must safeguard our people
from extinction.

28
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,360
Axis protect me!

29
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,360
Good, good...

30
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,000
Ilpo.
No move.

31
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,760
No move,
or marauder will see.

32
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,640
No move.

33
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,360
Ilpo in trouble now.
No move!

34
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,000
I told you...

35
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,240
I warned you...

36
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,080
Ilpo broken.

37
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,600
All broken.

38
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,000
Ilpo, it is me, Kaena.

39
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,000
Don't be frightened.

40
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,200
Ilpo broken again today.

41
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,240
Three times.

42
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,200
Always broken since long time.

43
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,760
You are not broken, Ilpo.

44
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,640
The bug's not looking too good,
but you're fine.

45
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,600
Here.

46
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,640
They don't grow like they used to.

47
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,360
It's weird, you have to go further
and further

48
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,600
to find vines that aren't dried up.

49
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,760
- How?
- Oh, that?

50
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,360
I had a little run-in with a sharken.

51
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,760
Kaena go too far.

52
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,640
Too close to Great Oblivion.

53
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,640
Oh, the Great Oblivion!

54
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:39,360
The sharkens aren’t afraid of it. You
should see them diving into the clouds.

55
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,360
Kaena get broken!
No come back.

56
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,080
You came back.

57
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,000
Why won't you tell me what you saw?

58
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,640
That.

59
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,640
That, everywhere.

60
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,000
You've seen this stuff before?

61
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,360
Past the clouds?
You saw it past the clouds?

62
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,080
Marauder attack.

63
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,360
Ilpo no move.

64
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Not to move.

65
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,640
Then fall, almost break.

66
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,600
The worm catch Ilpo.

67
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,840
The worm?
A worm caught you?

68
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,000
Then sleep.

69
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,360
Then see the man.

70
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,200
But not man...

71
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,080
Bad... bad!

72
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,080
Then too much light.

73
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,200
Very bright.

74
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,600
- Blue light.
- Blue light?

75
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,000
In my dreams, there's a blue sun.

76
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,000
Was it a blue sun below the clouds?

77
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,080
- Below or above.
- What?

78
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,360
Below or above.
Above or below.

79
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,200
Come on, Ilpo!

80
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,760
The Grand Priest!

81
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,360
Kaena must go!
Quick!

82
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,000
I know.
Time for another offering.

83
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,480
Hey, what's goin' on?

84
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,480
Did you just say something?

85
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,360
- Blurb
- No.

86
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,760
I heard you. Talk again!

87
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,480
That's ok. Pretend all you want.

88
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,000
Maybe you'll talk for my brother.

89
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,760
Kaena, where have you been?

90
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,240
Did you draw any more pictures?

91
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,600
- Show us Kaena!
- All right, all right.

92
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,200
But only if you promise not to tell.

93
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,000
The Grand Priest wouldn't like it.

94
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,480
- We promise.
- Uh-huh.

95
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,640
- You saw a sharken up close?
- Pretty close.

96
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,600
Is it a fast flier?

97
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,600
- Very fast.
- I'd love to have wings...

98
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,600
so I could be free.

99
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,240
You don't need wings to be free.

100
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,000
Imagine another world,

101
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,000
a beautiful place, with

102
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,600
a blue sun, and so much sap you can
swim in it.

103
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,000
Where is it Kaena? Have you seen it?

104
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,760
No. But I've dreamt about it and...

105
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,200
My children...

106
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,200
we know that the sap is vital
to our survival,

107
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,600
but with passing time,

108
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,480
it seems we are beginning to
exhaust our resources.

109
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,240
- That's right.
- What are we going to do about it?

110
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,760
I understand your suffering.

111
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,600
Your suffering is my suffering.

112
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,080
But we must not doubt!

113
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,640
Who made us a gift of the Axis?

114
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,360
Who protects us from
the Great Oblivion?

115
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,000
And its terrifying guardians?

116
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,080
The gods!

117
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,080
Who, at the moment of eternal peace,

118
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,640
opens the gates of paradise for us?

119
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,840
The gods!

120
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,080
Who has given us life?

121
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,840
The gods!

122
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,600
Yes, our gods!

123
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,240
Let us examine our consciences.

124
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,360
Kaena, you won't believe
what I found.

125
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,000
What is it this time, Essy?

126
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,760
A worm that talks. I've got him in
the pen.

127
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,080
I want to see.

128
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,840
Why are they holding us?

129
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,360
They plan to eat us.

130
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,600
We have to escape from here.
Follow me!

131
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,360
Right. Ok, there's still some work
to be done here

132
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,480
but not by me.
I'm gonna go get my wings,

133
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,840
and get out of here!

134
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,600
The master will want a full report
of this.

135
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,480
- How silly, Essy.
- Hey, don't make fun of him!

136
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,080
I bet that worm talks better
than you.

137
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,840
- On my word, that's so silly.
- Hey, Kaena...

138
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,080
- You like my brother, don't you?
- He's all right. A bit dull.

139
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,480
Is our faith unshakable?

140
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Yes!

141
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,000
Do we not owe everything to our
benevolent gods?

142
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,240
Then raise our offering to
the Well of the gods!

143
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,240
The gods are angry!

144
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,760
We'll be cast into the
Great Oblivion!

145
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,000
No, my children, no!

146
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,680
This is a sign, don't you understand?

147
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,760
The gods are testing us.

148
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,880
Testing our faith.

149
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,040
We must trust in them, and put
our lives in their hands!

150
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,400
Stay where you are.
To move

151
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,040
is to defy the gods.

152
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,040
Be pure. Kneel.

153
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,400
Pray!

154
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,560
May the will of the gods be done!

155
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,880
Kaena, wait up!

156
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,680
Kaena, what are you doing?

157
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,000
He moved, Zehos.
The Grand Priest moved.

158
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,400
The gods saved him.

159
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,760
The gods don't care about him.
They don't care about us!

160
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,760
She's right. Why did they destroy
the temple?

161
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,200
You. Go fix the pen!

162
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,400
- But it's true...
- Now!

163
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,400
Don't do anything stupid.

164
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,000
I saw you move!

165
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,760
My parents moved, and you
called them Impure!

166
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,240
- Are you Impure?
- Kaena, you're upset.

167
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,240
You moved to save yourself.

168
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,680
The gods moved me.
They guided me.

169
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,240
- It is they who saved me.
- No.

170
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,680
The gods don't save anyone.
They didn't save my parents.

171
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,480
Your parents did not put their
trust in the gods, Kaena.

172
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:12,760
So, why would the gods protect them?
Your parents made their choice.

173
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,560
I pray that it's not the choice that
you will make.

174
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,200
Pray?

175
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,680
What's the point of that?

176
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,200
Your gods are deaf.
If they even exist.

177
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,240
Life is hard.

178
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,680
After your parents died, I raised
you as my own daughter.

179
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,880
Took pride in your intelligence,
your spirit.

180
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,680
And it wounds me that now you turn
your gifts to blaspheming the gods

181
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,200
instead of worshipping them.

182
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,680
Think of the life that awaits us
beyond Axis!

183
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,480
Oh, I do!

184
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,000
- All the time.
- Ah, of course...

185
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,040
You think I am not aware you fill the
children's heads with harmful lies?

186
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,200
Showing them drawings of imaginary
creatures and places.

187
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,200
They're not imaginary, I've seen...

188
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,560
- In your dreams, is that it?
- They're real.

189
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,200
I've seen another world. I've seen a
blue sun at the base of Axis.

190
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,880
Listen to yourself, Kaena.

191
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,040
Raving, like poor Ilpo.

192
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,880
Do you want to become like him?

193
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,040
Mashing bugs and whimpering in
your sleep?

194
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,880
He's not crazy. He went past the
clouds and saw...

195
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,680
The Great Oblivion!
And it made him mad!

196
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,200
No!

197
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,560
Look at this! This object is harder
than the hardest sap.

198
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,400
Whoever made it was certainly not
afraid of your gods.

199
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,200
Do not provoke the gods!

200
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,880
- Give me that!
- No.

201
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,480
You're trying to kill me.

202
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,400
- No, I only wanted...
- You've gone mad!

203
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,200
You've become a danger to us all.

204
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,680
Catch Kaena before she harms
someone else.

205
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,400
Her actions are angering the gods,

206
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,400
and putting all of our lives in peril.

207
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,560
Find her before she escapes
the village.

208
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,560
I saw her! This way.

209
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,560
So, even a tough girl like you
can cry.

210
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,560
I thought you'd come here.

211
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,040
I haven't been down here since
we were kids.

212
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,760
But, we're not kids any more.

213
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,200
You were right.

214
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,200
Oh, Zehos, what am I gonna do?

215
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,040
Is that the knife?

216
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,560
He grabbed it, and I wasn't even
thinking and just pulled away, and...

217
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,000
I know you didn't try to kill him.
Look...

218
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,760
I'll talk to the Grand Priest. He'll
let you come back to the village.

219
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,040
I'd rather disappear into the Great
Oblivion than go back.

220
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,400
- Come on, Kaena!
- Listen to me!

221
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,400
There is another world out there.

222
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,760
And I'm gonna find it.

223
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,760
I'm sorry Grand Priest.
There's no sign of her.

224
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,680
May the will of the gods be done.

225
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,000
Hail to you, gods of my people!

226
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,200
I trust our offering was acceptable.

227
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,560
No!

228
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,200
It was not acceptable.

229
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,240
Is this the best you can do
for your gods?

230
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,560
I'm sorry, Almighty!

231
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,000
Great troubles afflict our village.

232
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,560
The sap is drying up and...

233
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,760
We have a heretic. A young girl
who dishonours you.

234
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,560
- How?
- She has run away, Almighty.

235
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,560
She wants to enter the
Great Oblivion...

236
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,240
Is your authority so weak over
your people?

237
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,480
It is just one girl, Almighty.

238
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,760
- She has always been...
- One heretic...

239
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,680
can pollute the others with
impure ideas.

240
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
And then hardship will come to
all of your people.

241
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,480
The girl is already dead.
Think no more of her.

242
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,240
Turn your devotion to
the next harvest.

243
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,400
Do not insult us again!

244
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,200
We will not, Almighty.

245
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,240
You remember when we were kids,

246
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,680
we used to have these contests, see
who'd go farthest from the village.

247
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,560
And I'd always win.

248
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,000
Weren't you ever afraid?

249
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,880
Sure I was. But I didn't want you
to know.

250
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,400
Anyway, I knew that Axis would always
show me the way back.

251
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,240
"Axis, protect me!". That's what you
used to say, right?

252
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,000
Like it was something alive.

253
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,680
It is alive. It talks to me.

254
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,760
Listen, when were kids it was
all right...

255
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,200
But now we're supposed to be
all grown up, right?

256
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,400
And spend our lives harvesting sap
and eating worms and...

257
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,200
never wondering what's on the
other side of the clouds?

258
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,040
I didn't say that.

259
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,560
All I mean is...
Someone has to harvest the sap and...

260
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,400
repair the huts and tend the worms.

261
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,200
Oh, you know, you used to be
interesting.

262
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,240
Now you're boring.
Now you raise worms.

263
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,000
What else are we supposed to eat?

264
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,040
Anyway, I've got a little brother
to look after.

265
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,040
- I can't just...
- Daydream like me, right?

266
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,200
- Go wire worms, Zehos!
- Kaena?

267
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,000
My children...

268
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,560
the gods appeared
to me last night.

269
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,680
They spoke to me.

270
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,760
They will punish Kaena.

271
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,240
And her treason has made them angry.

272
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,760
The gods are demanding another
harvest of sap,

273
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,880
by day's end.

274
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,240
Our offering must be better...

275
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,560
or we will all perish.

276
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:01,480
Let us raise our offering
to the Well of the gods!

277
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,000
Sap.

278
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,200
I need more.

279
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,880
There may not be much more,
my queen.

280
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,480
Sap is drying up.

281
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,400
The villagers can't find any more.

282
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,680
I don't care about slaves!

283
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,680
Death!

284
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,200
Once we've killed that thing
there will be.

285
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,400
Your Majesty,

286
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,200
we have been trying to kill it for
hundreds of years.

287
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,400
And these slaves are beginning
to doubt.

288
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,000
If we ignore this, a riot could come.

289
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,400
I beg you, my queen,

290
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,480
to consider the fusion now.

291
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,040
And what of our descendants?

292
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,400
Bled dry of sap by this monster?

293
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,000
Destroy!

294
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,200
It must be destroyed!

295
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,480
Your will be done, my queen.

296
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,760
Kaena, I...

297
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,760
It's ok, Zehos.

298
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,560
You've got to take care of Essy.

299
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,480
I'm sorry.

300
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,880
Find her!

301
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,400
A marauder!

302
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,000
Oh no! I'll see if she's all right.

303
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,000
No villager could have invented
that worm's armour.

304
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,680
There must be a survivor.

305
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:57,760
Carefully.

306
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,240
Master, if I may respectfully submit,

307
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,040
this is a complete and total
waste of time.

308
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,560
She's nothing but a primitive being.

309
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,560
A surprising specimen.

310
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,560
This is the one you're telling
me about, Assad?

311
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,560
- Are you sure?
- Yes, Master. It's her.

312
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,400
She's not like the others.
She's curious,

313
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,200
and she's got a kind of intuition.

314
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,560
And the way she moves, it's as if she
knows every branch and root.

315
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,240
And twice, I mean twice,

316
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,400
I've seen her close he eyes and just
jump. As if something were guiding her.

317
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,240
- Not terribly scientific, Assad.
- I should say not.

318
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,880
But you say you've heard talk of a
blue sun at the bottom of Axis?

319
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,000
Master, a delusional worm-eater
sees a blue sun,

320
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,760
and suddenly she's a prophet?
Please, Master,

321
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,760
This is completely irrational.
It hurts my brain! Ow!

322
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,000
It really does.

323
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,000
But what if Vecanoi survived the
crash, Gommi?

324
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,480
That is an impossibility, Master.

325
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,200
Vecanoi was destroyed along with
everything else.

326
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,680
It's all just scrap metal,
scattered across Axis.

327
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,480
Most of it went into building
this place.

328
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,880
So it's as if she somehow
imagined Vecanoi?

329
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,000
Yes, master. An egg is what she
imagined. She saw a blue egg.

330
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,240
A nice, glowing blue egg.

331
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,040
Maybe if we all thought it was a blue
egg we could move on with our lives?

332
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,480
What's this?

333
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,560
Oh, she's violent too!

334
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,560
Back off, you... you creatures
of the Oblivion!

335
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,400
You back off! And calm down.

336
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,760
You have nothing to fear from us.

337
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,480
Why have you brought her back here,
Gommi?

338
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,280
Don't ask me. Ask this genius.
Why did we?

339
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,400
She needed help.

340
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,280
And what do they do with the worms?

341
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,280
They eat them.

342
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,640
That's disgusting!

343
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,160
And they enjoy it.

344
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,480
Barbarians!

345
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,160
The Master

346
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,800
would like to speak to you now.

347
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,880
What are they doing?

348
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,280
They're making the penultimate
preparations to facilitate lift-off.

349
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,800
Lift-off?

350
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,400
Yes, this entire base
is an intergalactic vessel.

351
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,800
What's that?

352
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,280
Typical humanoid beh... I'd don't
think you'd be able to understand.

353
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,640
Assad, the Master wants

354
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,640
- you to come as well.
- OK.

355
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,160
You may take it.

356
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,800
It's yours.

357
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,040
Are.. are you gods?

358
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,800
No. My name is Opaz.

359
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,560
I am a mortal, just as you are.

360
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,400
I'm sorry we frightened you.
We mean you no harm.

361
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,400
You were badly injured, so we

362
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,480
treated your wounds.

363
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,800
- And my knife?
- Later.

364
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,560
Your clothes are being repaired,
by my prosthetics.

365
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,400
You mean the worms?

366
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,800
"Worms"?

367
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,040
Worms?

368
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,280
We happen to be hyper-evolved
vermaform oligochaetes,

369
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,640
with cognitive abilities far beyond
the best artificial intelligence.

370
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,880
Let me explain something to you.
I, myself, can speak 1200 languages.

371
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,040
identify over 10,000 galaxies,
you see,

372
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:43,000
and repair virtually any form of
silicon-based technology. Hmm-hmm.

373
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,640
"Worms"? Pfff.. Indeed!

374
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,400
- We are worms.
- No we are not just worms!

375
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,400
- We are worms!
- And don't you talk Worm to me!

376
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,800
I heard you all back there,
talking Worm.

377
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
And it's undignified.

378
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,040
It's disgusting!
It's beneath you.

379
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,000
But it is our language.

380
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,800
I do not talk "Worm".

381
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,640
I think I like our worms better.
They don't talk this much.

382
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:10,560
Let me explain to you, humanoid.
Those specimens are sadly not evolved.

383
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,040
You'll find that I, however, am your
superior, in every respect.

384
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,040
Except that I can eat you.

385
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,040
I hope not.

386
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,560
I would be quite lost without
Gommi and the others.

387
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,400
I wouldn't have survived
without them.

388
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,640
And I certainly couldn't have built
this ship to return home.

389
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,000
Where is your home?

390
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,800
Far away from here.

391
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,640
My queen,

392
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,160
this thing has defied your attacks
for centuries.

393
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,040
It may outlive us all.

394
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,560
And if something should happen to
you or I,

395
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,800
our race will be forever
extinguished.

396
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,000
As queen, you must protect
your people.

397
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:21,040
Fusion?
I know what you want, Voxem.

398
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,280
I know you are the last male.

399
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,560
And that you crave fusioning
with me.

400
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,800
- But our future?
- Future?

401
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,880
There will be no future
while this thing lives.

402
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,560
That problem may solve itself,
my queen.

403
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,000
I believe that one of the invaders
may have survived,

404
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,560
living high on Axis.

405
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,280
If we can find him, he can
take this thing away.

406
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,800
I decide!

407
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,560
Your world is not quite
as you imagined it, Kaena.

408
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,480
Your world is Astria,
and here

409
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,400
its twin, Tales,

410
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,160
which you saw for the first time
last night.

411
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,280
Hundreds of years ago,

412
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,160
a Vecarian ship carrying
thousands of my people

413
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,280
exploded in space,
near your planet.

414
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,000
I was the only survivor.

415
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,280
- Axis!
- Yes.

416
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,400
This is your home, Kaena.

417
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,480
It was within these branches
that my crib finally landed.

418
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,640
It was Axis that saved me.

419
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,800
Your people live in the
middle of Axis, here,

420
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,640
at the exact point where the
gravitational forces

421
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,880
of the two planets cancel
each other out.

422
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,040
And we're here.

423
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,160
All the time I was going down to
the roots of Axis,

424
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,560
but I was really going up?

425
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,400
Below is above and above is
below!

426
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,880
Ilpo was right.
You saved him.

427
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,280
I only dressed his wounds.

428
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,560
As I did for many other
creatures of Axis.

429
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,400
- So that's where the blue sun is.
- Blue sun?

430
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,280
Yes, I've dreamed of it so many times.
It's down there, at the roots of Axis.

431
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,160
Look!

432
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,640
- It's Vecanoi
- What's Vecanoi?

433
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,480
All the knowledge of my people
is contained in its brain.

434
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,560
It was transmitted to all
Vecarians as children.

435
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,280
- It's our memory.
- So, it really exists.

436
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,560
Master,

437
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,800
no good can come of listening to a
worm-eater with an I.Q. of 2!

438
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,800
I think you might be underestimating
her just a little bit, Gommi.

439
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,560
In a matter of days, the ship
will be ready.

440
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,800
And then we can leave this
pitiful, little world.

441
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:10,000
It's what you've always wanted,
Master.

442
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,480
It's what you've always wanted.

443
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,160
But the chance to retrieve Vecanoi,

444
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,160
to save all the knowledge that he
didn't have time to pass on to me!

445
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,560
You should have let her get eaten!
But no...

446
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,400
you had to save her,
bring her back to the ship.

447
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:29,800
Master, perhaps we should journey to
the base of Axis, just to make sure.

448
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,400
Perhaps, Assad.

449
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,000
You miss her too, don't you?

450
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,480
She's coming back, isn't she?

451
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,400
Soon, I hope soon.

452
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,640
Did she go to that other world?

453
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,560
I don't know. Maybe.

454
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,480
You should've gone with her!

455
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,400
Maybe you're right, Essy.
Maybe you're right.

456
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,800
Help!

457
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:39,280
- Ilpo?
- Quake! Quake!

458
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,560
Now!

459
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Essy! Essy!

460
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,000
Have you seen my brother?

461
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,640
No. The gods are testing us again.

462
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,280
- We must pray.
- Zehos!

463
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,800
I had a terrible nightmare.

464
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,160
Excuse me?

465
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,040
This is the unstable behaviour
I've been talking about.

466
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,000
Listen to me! The blue sun,
Vecanoi, was being attacked by

467
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,800
some evil force, and...

468
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,560
Only the impure move!

469
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,040
Do not mock the gods!

470
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,160
Kneel!

471
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,000
- No! Get up!
- Pray!

472
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,280
The square is going to collapse.
Come on!

473
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,800
May the will of the gods be done.

474
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,640
Is this what happened in
your nightmare?

475
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,560
Vecanoi? Was it... destroyed?

476
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,160
No, but it suffered.
And when Vecanoi suffers, Axis suffers.

477
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,800
- They are linked, aren't they?
- I don't know.

478
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,640
Axis is in danger.
The village...

479
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,800
Zehos and Essy and the children...

480
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,800
- I have to go.
- Wait!

481
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,160
We'll go together.
First to your village

482
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,800
then to find Vecanoi.

483
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:58,280
Come on, big guy.
I know you can talk.

484
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,480
- How much longer can this go on?
- Calm yourself!

485
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,800
Gods of my people, my gods,

486
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,640
we are in need of you.

487
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,560
Our village is destroyed,

488
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,280
and we don't know where to go.

489
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,160
Please, answer us.

490
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,000
Answer me!

491
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,400
Is everything alright?

492
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:01,400
Come, Enode.
I have good news for our people.

493
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,400
The gods have spoken to me.

494
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,880
What did they tell you?
Do they offer us help?

495
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,400
Better than help, Enode.
Deliverance!

496
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,000
Our suffering has finally been rewarded.

497
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,560
The gods have destroyed our village.

498
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,400
- But why?
- I don't...

499
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,880
So that we may go to join them.

500
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,880
The gods have called us.

501
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,800
They will give us shelter, Enode.

502
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,160
We have passed the final test!

503
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,560
Let everyone know,
we leave tomorrow.

504
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,040
- Are you ready?
- Yes...

505
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,880
- Fine, fine. And...
- I'm not fine!

506
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:03,000
Continue with the final preparations.

507
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,880
When I return,
we proceed to lift-off.

508
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:08,280
Master, this expedition is
much too risky.

509
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,800
Please reconsider!
Please?

510
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,560
Vecanoi exists, Gommi.

511
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:17,000
And Kaena seems to have some special
relationship with it.

512
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,640
Can't say I'm crazy about
these knew clothes.

513
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,800
They're to protect you, Kaena.

514
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,280
I'd feel a lot better with my knife.

515
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,280
Let us depart!

516
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,800
What? You're best friends with
the worm-eater now?

517
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:52,280
- Ready to fly?
- Oh! I get to fly?

518
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:14,000
Come on, Assad! Faster!

519
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,560
She's crazy, master. And she has
the brain of a slug.

520
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,400
Zumo, are you okay?

521
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:37,640
Look out!

522
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,880
Poor Zumo!

523
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,400
- I am so sorry, Gommi.
- Sorry won't bring him back.

524
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,160
Master, it's not worth it.

525
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,560
We cannot risk our lives trusting
her stupid visions.

526
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,160
The success of this mission
is beyond our own lives.

527
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,400
We must face our destiny.

528
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,800
Time is running out.

529
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,640
See? I told you.
I knew this was a bad idea.

530
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,640
A very bad idea.

531
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,280
We should go back to the base
before we all get killed.

532
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:41,280
'Cause we're all gonna be killed.

533
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,480
The sooner we leave this wretched
world, the better.

534
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,800
The harvest is over.
We are free!

535
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,160
Come on, everyone.
Run to meet the gods!

536
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,640
The gods are opening the doors of
their world.

537
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,560
They've gone crazy. We can't stop them.

538
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,280
But the gods said...

539
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,640
There are no gods, Essy.
We have to go.

540
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,800
It's all right.
Let's go find Kaena.

541
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,000
That is not the way to paradise, Zehos.

542
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,040
The gods have summoned us.

543
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,640
I saw you in the temple

544
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,800
I saw you begging the gods
and they didn't come!

545
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,880
Silence this impure one!

546
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:25,800
Run, Essy! Go!

547
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,640
You have just sent your brother

548
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,040
to his death.

549
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,400
What are we doing here?

550
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,160
Gommi, it's quiet.

551
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:28,400
Yeah. Too quiet.

552
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,160
- It's close.
- What's close?

553
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,000
- I don't hear anything?
- Be quiet!

554
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,800
I'm not hearing anything and my
hearing is biotechnically enhanced.

555
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,160
So I should be the one who's hearing...

556
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,160
No move!

557
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,280
Or marauder will see.

558
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,400
Opaz, Gommi, don't move!

559
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,000
- Master, let's move!
- Gommi, stay still!

560
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,160
Let's leave now!

561
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:58,400
There you are, damned invader!

562
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:03,800
Now you will come and kill this
thing you left behind.

563
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,160
Do not kill him!

564
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,160
Kill her!

565
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,480
We fly my brothers and sisters!

566
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:06,280
We fly to meet our gods.

567
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:15,000
I must tell her what I intend
to do, Gommi.

568
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,640
I wouldn't be too hasty, Master.

569
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:21,280
If Vecanoi and Axis are truly linked,

570
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:24,160
what will happen when I
retrieve Vecanoi?

571
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,800
How do I know Axis won't be destroyed?

572
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,040
But this is a dying world, Master.

573
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,560
But it is her world, Gommi.

574
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,400
She has a right to know.

575
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,640
- Garoop.
- Garoop yourself.

576
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:42,000
If only I could persuade her
to leave with us.

577
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,280
If you had the chance,

578
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,640
would you leave Axis?

579
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,560
It's my home.

580
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,560
You could make another,

581
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,160
in a world less hostile.

582
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,280
A place bountiful enough

583
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,280
you would have time to learn, to dream,

584
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:16,160
to build a civilization.

585
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:40,160
No! Ilpo!

586
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,160
Got you!

587
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,560
- Essy, what are you doing here?
- Kaena!

588
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,280
Ilpo took care of me.

589
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,160
Kaena not broken.

590
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:06,000
It's all right, Ilpo.
They're friends.

591
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,800
They saved my life,
and yours too.

592
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:13,000
- What's going on here?
- Agroop?

593
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:17,480
Essy, where is Zehos?

594
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,800
They go into the well of the gods.

595
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,280
All go up inside. Village gone.

596
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,480
Something terrible awaits them.

597
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:34,040
I dreamt it.
I've go to find them.

598
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:37,480
We don't have time for this.
What about Vecanoi, hmm?

599
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,400
You do talk!
I knew it!

600
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:41,800
I knew I was right.

601
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:44,640
Essy, you stay here with Ilpo
until I get back.

602
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,040
I'm coming too.
I want Zehos.

603
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:50,640
It is too dangerous, Essy.
I'll bring him back.

604
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,160
I promise.

605
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:00,800
Assad, I want you to stay here
and protect Ilpo and the boy.

606
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,400
It would be an honour.

607
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,160
Master, you're not...

608
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:07,160
You're not going there alone?
You can't be serious.

609
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:12,640
Master, if you think I'm staying here
you're crazy. I'm coming too.

610
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,400
I wouldn't have it any other way, Gommi.

611
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:46,040
Ok, let me help you.

612
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:48,160
Because there's "floating" and
there's "flying".

613
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,160
"Floating", you don't know where
you're going. "Flying", you do.

614
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,880
We should reorientate ourselves now.

615
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:12,800
What?
No.

616
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,160
No!

617
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:16,560
Kaena, look out!

618
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:24,280
Hold on, Gommi!

619
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:29,160
Oh, sticky goo... Yuck!

620
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:32,400
Um, if I could just remind you...
I'm not built for this.

621
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:35,480
- Thank you, Gommi.
- You're welcome, I guess.

622
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:49,640
Our queen has become obsessed
with her attacks.

623
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,880
And with each attack,
more of us die in vain

624
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:55,880
sucked into her body
to make it stronger.

625
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Who will be next?

626
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:03,160
The queen fears the "ultimate fusion"

627
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:08,400
because she knows that she will
have to sacrifice her own life

628
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:11,160
to create new life.

629
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:14,640
A new generation of Selenites.

630
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,560
Join with me

631
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:20,880
so that we may live.

632
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:39,400
There's something I must tell you.

633
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:40,480
What?

634
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:45,280
You, your people, Axis...

635
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:49,000
all of you are in danger because of me.

636
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:53,280
Remember, you asked
if Vecanoi and Axis were linked.

637
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:57,040
They are not just linked.
They are the same.

638
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:01,280
The crash of my ship,
the birth of Axis

639
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:04,040
happened at exactly the same time.

640
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,160
Vecanoi created Axis.

641
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:09,480
And if I am to remove Vecanoi...

642
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:11,400
What do you mean "remove"?

643
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,040
I must bring it back to my people.

644
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,560
And what about my people? My world?

645
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:21,480
- I fear Axis will die.
- But we'll die.

646
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:24,560
How can you accept sacrificing
so many people?

647
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:28,280
I used to think your people were too
primitive to care about their destiny.

648
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,280
Until I met you, Kaena.

649
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:34,880
Please, come with us. There's room
for you on our ship.

650
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:36,800
And all of my people?

651
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,400
You don't realize the power we need
to reach the...

652
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:42,560
- And you knew that from the start?
- Kaena,

653
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,880
your world is dying.

654
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:47,880
And you must realize how important
Vecanoi is!

655
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:50,280
I curse the day I met you!

656
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:55,040
Here! You might need this to get back
to your ship. My people need me.

657
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,480
Axis, protect me!

658
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,160
Please, have mercy.

659
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,560
The gods will help us,
they promised me.

660
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:32,160
Don't you get it? Your gods are
nothing but sap monsters!

661
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:35,400
Perhaps the gods are merely angry.

662
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:38,880
- We must pray and ask.
- We trusted you!

663
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:42,160
No, wait.
Let's not waste our time!

664
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:43,560
There's got to be a way out of here.

665
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:22,560
So, little one.

666
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:25,400
It's you who killed by marauder.

667
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:30,280
How lucky you are
to finally meet your gods.

668
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:32,480
You are not gods.

669
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:36,560
- What have you done to my people?
- You are nothing but slaves.

670
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:40,560
Before the arrival of the blue monster,
you didn't even exist.

671
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:44,160
Your species
is a vile aberration.

672
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:49,160
Too bad we aren't compatible,
little one.

673
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:53,560
Fusing with your perfect little body

674
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:58,480
would be so much more pleasant
than what awaits me with my queen.

675
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:03,400
Where is the old man?

676
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:06,160
- Where is the invader?
- I don't know.

677
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,560
You lie, slave.

678
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:13,000
Why would such a powerful god
worry about a sick old man?

679
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:14,560
Never mind.

680
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:17,040
We know where to wait for him.

681
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:21,560
He will come to us.
Put her with the others!

682
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:31,280
It's Kaena.
She's alive!

683
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:34,560
Zehos, you survived.

684
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:38,480
But Essy...
I don't know what happened to him.

685
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:41,040
He's safe, back at the village
with Ilpo.

686
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,000
I knew that you would come save us.

687
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:50,000
Gommi!

688
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:52,880
- Come on, follow the worm!
- A talking worm!

689
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:55,480
- Where is Opaz?
- He went to find Vecanoi

690
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:57,880
These monsters are waiting for him.

691
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:00,400
- They want him to kill Vecanoi
- I don't care about Vecanoi!

692
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:03,040
All I care about is the Master.
Stupid, stupid, stupid,

693
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,480
I should have never let him go alone.

694
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:30,040
Take them back to the Well of the gods,
back to the village.

695
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:32,400
- You're not coming?
- I don't have time to explain.

696
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:34,160
I've got to find Vecanoi and Opaz.

697
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:35,400
But what about us?

698
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:38,400
None of us are safe unless
I do this, Zehos.

699
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:41,000
- I've got to.
- What about me?

700
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,280
I don't want to lose you a second time.

701
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
You'll never lose me.

702
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:49,400
I'm coming with you.
I've got to find the Master.

703
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,480
Gommi, you'll need to show them
the way.

704
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:54,000
I'll find him, Gommi.
I promise.

705
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,800
Please, we need you.

706
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:01,400
We're just primitive, unevolved
worm-eaters. And we need you.

707
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,880
All right then.
To the Well of the gods. No further.

708
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,160
Then I'm coming back for the Master.

709
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,000
Here.

710
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:13,280
Can't believe I'm saying this, but...
Good luck, Kaena!

711
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,800
Thank you, my friend.

712
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,440
It leads to the village.
Go, now.

713
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:47,360
- It's the only way.
- Well, worm-eater,

714
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:49,880
- This is where I leave you.
- Wait, I'm coming with you.

715
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:52,000
I'm not leaving without Kaena.

716
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:06,000
Vecanoi!

717
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:08,680
Hear me!
I have come for you.

718
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:22,040
Vecanoi, speak to me!
Open for me!

719
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,800
Your monster...

720
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,800
Your monster killed my planet.

721
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:52,040
- Our ship crashed.
- Your monster steels our sap!

722
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:54,800
We meant you no harm.

723
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:57,680
Your monster starves my people.

724
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:59,680
You created it,

725
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:02,160
you will kill it.

726
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:05,000
I can't kill it.

727
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,360
Vecanoi will not listen to me.

728
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:09,680
He will not open.

729
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:14,040
He has forgotten me.

730
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:15,440
Then you...

731
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:18,440
will die!

732
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:42,000
Fuse, my queen!

733
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,360
It's real!

734
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:37,360
No!
Opaz!

735
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,240
I'm getting you out of here, Opaz.

736
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,600
- Just hold on!
- You...

737
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,800
did it, Kaena.

738
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:52,600
It's you. It's you.

739
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:55,600
I haven't done anything.

740
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:59,880
Tell me what to do, Opaz.
Tell me what to do!

741
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:16,160
Monster!

742
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:19,160
I finally see you.

743
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,880
Now, you will die.

744
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:35,600
Slave!

745
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:55,040
Children...

746
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:57,800
not yet.

747
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,360
Not until I kill!

748
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,360
Kaena!

749
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:54,040
Kaena, wake up!
Please, Kaena!

750
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,040
- Kaena
- Opaz?

751
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,040
Where are you?

752
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:07,240
Listen to me, Kaena.

753
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:11,160
My people are no more.

754
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:13,600
I was the last.

755
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:17,680
All the others died hundreds of
years ago when their ship crashed.

756
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:21,600
Only Vecanoi survived.

757
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:25,680
So he created a gigantic
reservoir of life,

758
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:29,360
Axis, so that you could exist,

759
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,360
you humans.

760
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:34,600
Vecanoi created you.

761
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,680
I don't understand.

762
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:42,800
He chose you to carry the memory
of the Vecarian people.

763
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:46,000
He chose you, Kaena.

764
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:49,360
Now you are the future.

765
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,880
You must lead your people.

766
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:53,680
But how?

767
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:56,000
How will I know what to do?

768
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:02,000
Kaena!

769
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:09,880
Kaena!

770
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:13,000
Come on, Kaena, wake up!

771
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:14,800
Stay with me!

772
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,600
Gommi!

773
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,360
Gommi!

774
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:17,160
Zehos!
Kaena!

775
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:24,600
- Gommi
- Assad

776
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:26,600
The Master?

777
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:30,800
Kaena, wake up!

778
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,440
She is dead.

779
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:36,800
Kaena is dead.

780
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:39,680
Who will be our guide now?

781
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:52,880
She's moving!

782
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:54,880
She's alive!

783
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:18,800
There's no more sap, no more water.

784
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:21,360
How will we live?

785
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:50,440
He chose you, Kaena.

786
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:53,440
You must lead your people.

787
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:59,880
No, stand up!

788
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:02,680
This is nothing compared
to what all of us can learn.

789
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:08,680
Beyond the clouds is a
wide universe.

790
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:12,000
Millions of suns shine
on unknown worlds

791
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:14,160
sheltering so many people.

792
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:16,600
I am no leader.

793
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:19,360
All my knowledge is yours.

794
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:22,360
No one must think for you!

795
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,880
You are free now.
We are free.

796
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,800
Oh, come on, people.
It won't hurt you.

797
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,240
Watch!

798
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:54,360
Kaena, the new world,
will it be beautiful?

799
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,360
Yes.
