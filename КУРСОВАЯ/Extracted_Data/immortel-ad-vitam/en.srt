1
00:02:52,616 --> 00:02:56,408
CONDEMNED TO DEATH BY HIS PEERS
FOR REBELLION

2
00:02:56,783 --> 00:03:00,325
HORUS FROM HIERAKONOPOLIS,
THE GOD OF HEAVENS,

3
00:03:00,575 --> 00:03:04,450
HAS SEVEN DAYS TO SEE THE EARTH
OF MANKIND

4
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,575
ONCE MORE,
THE EARTH HE HELPED CREATE.

5
00:03:08,866 --> 00:03:13,658
SEVEN DAYS: THE TIME FOR ONE BEAT
OF THE DIVINE HEART.

6
00:03:13,741 --> 00:03:15,283
NOT A SECOND MORE.

7
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,033
BEFORE BEING DEPRIVED
OF HIS IMMORTALITY

8
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:22,075
BUT EVEN THE GODS FEAR DEATH

9
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:37,366
Heru?
Horus?

10
00:03:38,575 --> 00:03:39,700
Meru
It's time

11
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,533
Ta em sertu en maa abtet!
Make the most of your last moments

12
00:03:43,783 --> 00:03:46,950
Seven days, HORUS, seven hourglasses...
Not a second more.

13
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:50,741
Semut bat.
Trust me

14
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,616
I know you're there...

15
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,825
Hey! Look over there!

16
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:17,991
What is this?

17
00:04:18,366 --> 00:04:20,991
A naked man with a bird head.

18
00:04:22,366 --> 00:04:25,158
What's going on? I lose control.

19
00:04:25,408 --> 00:04:29,950
There is no answer...
Right me, right me

20
00:04:36,783 --> 00:04:40,075
Children...my humans children.

21
00:04:40,616 --> 00:04:44,033
I am back.

22
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:34,116
...Now, I'm also in charge of the nano
implants department...

23
00:05:34,283 --> 00:05:37,449
...but we concentrate more
on synthetic skin.

24
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:39,283
No hard feelings, then.

25
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:40,991
Thank you for reminding me!

26
00:05:41,783 --> 00:05:42,491
Can I take two?

27
00:05:42,741 --> 00:05:46,033
No. Only one this time.

28
00:05:46,616 --> 00:05:49,866
There're maybe no hard feelings
but you're still tight-fisted?

29
00:05:50,074 --> 00:05:51,491
Fuck you, Elma.

30
00:05:51,658 --> 00:05:53,033
You should be so lucky.

31
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,033
That girl's dangerous.

32
00:06:09,491 --> 00:06:11,283
She must be on pretty powerful stuff...

33
00:06:11,533 --> 00:06:14,783
She managed to damage a carrier
when they were selecting them...

34
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:16,866
When they were rounding them up,
you mean...

35
00:06:17,116 --> 00:06:18,866
That's why I'm interested in her...

36
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:21,658
I see that you're involved in illegal
medicine more than ever.

37
00:06:22,074 --> 00:06:24,741
Resistance medicine,
there's a difference.

38
00:06:25,783 --> 00:06:28,158
You really like her, don't you?

39
00:06:28,658 --> 00:06:30,366
I'm taking her with me.

40
00:06:30,908 --> 00:06:33,699
I'll need a supply of antibiotics,
even old ones...

41
00:06:33,908 --> 00:06:34,533
and microneedles...

42
00:06:34,783 --> 00:06:36,324
Not so fast, darling!

43
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:41,074
I want a detailed report of all
the analyses you perform on her.

44
00:06:41,324 --> 00:06:44,658
And don't even try to pretend that
you've lost the file!

45
00:06:44,824 --> 00:06:46,658
You can have her, but I want the file!

46
00:07:09,574 --> 00:07:11,658
His mother has been treated...

47
00:07:12,783 --> 00:07:17,366
He's waiting for her
to be returned to him.

48
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:19,949
How old are you?...

49
00:07:24,533 --> 00:07:25,533
Let's go...

50
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:52,574
... But you openly accuse
Senator Allgood

51
00:07:52,783 --> 00:07:54,324
of manipulating public opinion.

52
00:07:54,366 --> 00:07:55,824
Do you think he's the one who organized

53
00:07:55,991 --> 00:07:57,908
the pyramid affair
in order to get elected?

54
00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:01,199
No. His influence
doesn't run that deep.

55
00:08:01,408 --> 00:08:05,283
It's obvious that the pyramid
is extraterrestrial,

56
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:08,366
Like the INTRUSION zone
in Central Park...

57
00:08:08,574 --> 00:08:10,658
I don't agree with the view
that Intrusion

58
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:13,533
is a matrix of dangerous mutants.

59
00:08:13,533 --> 00:08:18,783
This rumor was spread by Allgood
to serve the interests of EUGENlCS.

60
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:23,824
Scientists have proved that Intrusion
is a GATEWAY to PARALLEL

61
00:08:24,074 --> 00:08:25,658
or EXTRATERRESTRIAL worlds.

62
00:08:25,658 --> 00:08:28,033
We'll have to face the fact that
we're not alone in the Universe...

63
00:08:28,366 --> 00:08:32,491
But in practical terms your program
doesn't seem very satisfactory.

64
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:34,949
You're putting all the blame
on the outgoing candidate,

65
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:36,241
Senator Allgood.

66
00:08:36,408 --> 00:08:39,116
...I'm also talking about
the medical dictatorship

67
00:08:39,324 --> 00:08:41,824
that ALLGOOD has imposed on NYC,

68
00:08:42,033 --> 00:08:45,199
with the active participation
of EUGENICS.

69
00:08:45,407 --> 00:08:49,157
I'm talking about raids,
illegal experiments,

70
00:08:49,366 --> 00:08:52,741
unauthorized blood-tests
and organ removal,

71
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:57,241
people going missing...
I'm talking about GLOBUS 1,

72
00:08:57,616 --> 00:08:59,199
you know what that is, don't you?

73
00:08:59,407 --> 00:09:01,949
It's the 'freezer'
used by the mad scientists

74
00:09:02,157 --> 00:09:03,782
that work for EUGENICS'...

75
00:09:03,866 --> 00:09:07,991
But you do agree there's a real
security problem, don't you?

76
00:09:07,241 --> 00:09:09,282
That series of murders on Level 2...

77
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:10,741
That's police business.

78
00:09:10,907 --> 00:09:13,616
I have full confidence
in the Federal Police.

79
00:09:13,657 --> 00:09:14,782
What a bitch!

80
00:09:15,116 --> 00:09:17,282
What a bitch!

81
00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:20,574
A bitch,
but a fast learner about politics.

82
00:09:20,782 --> 00:09:23,824
That's what I mean! A whore!

83
00:09:24,157 --> 00:09:26,699
That's enough... About those murders.

84
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:29,324
How many have been reported so far?

85
00:09:29,241 --> 00:09:30,157
Four.

86
00:09:30,407 --> 00:09:31,991
Who's in charge of the case?

87
00:09:32,241 --> 00:09:34,824
Inspector Froebe.
He's a specialist in the abnormal.

88
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,032
He thinks it's the work
of a serial killer.

89
00:09:37,241 --> 00:09:41,074
Froebe is no specialist.
Hunting is all he lives for,

90
00:09:41,324 --> 00:09:44,282
ever since he had his face chewed
on by the Dayak.

91
00:09:44,532 --> 00:09:46,449
He's a real psychopath.

92
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:48,074
He's a liability.

93
00:09:48,074 --> 00:09:49,949
I don't agree, Miss Liang.

94
00:09:50,407 --> 00:09:53,282
Froebe is a good cop, and anyway,
he's politically neutral.

95
00:09:53,282 --> 00:09:55,824
"Neutral!" ..."Neutral"
doesn't exist...

96
00:09:55,824 --> 00:09:59,324
There're only men and women...
Humans and aliens.

97
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,491
The integrated and the rejected.

98
00:10:01,532 --> 00:10:04,241
The whole fucking universe
is split into two...

99
00:10:24,032 --> 00:10:26,157
That makes five!
In less than 48 hours,

100
00:10:26,366 --> 00:10:28,241
that's got to be a record...

101
00:10:28,532 --> 00:10:30,241
Exactly the same M. O.

102
00:10:30,532 --> 00:10:34,032
It's just as if the body had exploded
from the inside.

103
00:10:34,241 --> 00:10:36,449
I was told there was a witness.

104
00:10:36,616 --> 00:10:38,616
Yeah! He's right over there,
he's waiting for you

105
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:42,741
Back at my office in an hour.

106
00:10:45,824 --> 00:10:49,282
You're alright?
I'll see you at Froebe's, OK?

107
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:52,407
Yeah... Yeah... All right!
I'll see you there.

108
00:10:53,366 --> 00:10:55,241
Are you sure you're alright?

109
00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:15,157
Hi...Mmm...

110
00:12:15,532 --> 00:12:19,157
What can I get you?

111
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:24,490
He wants to know if they're diseased.

112
00:12:24,615 --> 00:12:26,990
He asked you a question.

113
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,615
I... I'm fine, thanks.

114
00:12:28,824 --> 00:12:30,657
All your organs?!

115
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:33,990
I've... I've changed my lungs.
They're a Chinese model.

116
00:12:34,032 --> 00:12:36,449
Not bad... Pretty attractive...
and... I...

117
00:12:36,657 --> 00:12:40,115
I have a new bladder too,
no problem there.

118
00:12:46,782 --> 00:12:48,407
Still don't want a drink?

119
00:13:24,657 --> 00:13:25,574
Six.

120
00:13:26,032 --> 00:13:27,157
No. Seven.

121
00:13:27,324 --> 00:13:29,157
Outside the bar...the witness.

122
00:13:29,407 --> 00:13:30,990
The one I never got to see.

123
00:13:31,074 --> 00:13:32,282
That's right, the giant.

124
00:13:32,657 --> 00:13:34,949
He's the seventh and the agent who
was supposed

125
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:36,990
to bring him to you was the sixth.

126
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:38,907
Reminds you of the DAYAKS, doesn't it?

127
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,157
Cold blooded carnage like this,
right up their alley.

128
00:13:42,407 --> 00:13:44,324
The Dayaks are extinct.

129
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:48,282
They were all exterminated after
the riots, thirty years ago.

130
00:13:48,574 --> 00:13:51,282
Except the one that got you....

131
00:13:54,657 --> 00:13:56,282
Thank you, Sandy.

132
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:29,782
It's not going to hold but I can't do anything anymore...

133
00:14:30,407 --> 00:14:32,157
I did warn you.

134
00:14:32,157 --> 00:14:35,282
Only 35 percent of your original
metabolism remains

135
00:14:35,824 --> 00:14:37,490
you've modified
or replaced all the rest.

136
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,865
I have a contract with EUGENICS...

137
00:14:40,032 --> 00:14:42,157
I had guessed that much.

138
00:14:42,574 --> 00:14:44,699
Tell my colleague I sent you.

139
00:14:45,282 --> 00:14:48,657
He's a specialist
in nano- surgical repairs...

140
00:14:52,365 --> 00:14:53,907
Don't leave it too long.

141
00:14:58,032 --> 00:14:59,865
Thank you Doctor.

142
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:12,824
I'm so sorry, Jill. New Yorkers all
seem to have gone insane...

143
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:19,949
Where was I? Oh, Yes,
the lapse in your memory.

144
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:24,782
I was wondering what it is that
you don't want to remember so badly,

145
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:26,657
that you're this blocked?

146
00:15:27,365 --> 00:15:30,532
Put it another way;
what are you trying to forget?

147
00:15:30,824 --> 00:15:34,740
I can't remember anything,
there's a subtle difference.

148
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,615
But it seems
that you remembered to take

149
00:15:36,865 --> 00:15:39,240
strong doses of potentially dangerous

150
00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:42,324
substances as yet unidentified.

151
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,573
Do you have any on you?

152
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:49,782
Is your supplier on level 3,
in Little Paris,

153
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,573
amongst the non humans?

154
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,948
Some of them are very decent beings.

155
00:15:56,365 --> 00:15:58,032
You, for example...

156
00:16:07,615 --> 00:16:09,698
I have to tell you that
in 20 years of medicine

157
00:16:09,907 --> 00:16:12,573
I've never seen
a guinea pig quite like you...

158
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:17,282
I've never seen such a heart,

159
00:16:17,532 --> 00:16:20,532
lungs, or a womb like that... Never.

160
00:16:24,698 --> 00:16:29,032
You're built like someone who
was born less than three months ago...

161
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:32,073
Maybe that's what you want to forget?

162
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:40,573
Or what you're not sure about?
When did you get to New York?...

163
00:16:44,115 --> 00:16:45,948
And how?

164
00:16:51,907 --> 00:16:55,490
Some of the vertebrate animals
on this planet shed their skin,

165
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,823
You are going through
the same process...

166
00:17:00,198 --> 00:17:00,823
Listen to my offer! Work for me.

167
00:17:02,115 --> 00:17:05,365
Let me conduct
a thorough medical examination,

168
00:17:05,532 --> 00:17:08,365
take some samples,
test some medication...

169
00:17:08,615 --> 00:17:09,907
If you trust me,

170
00:17:10,073 --> 00:17:12,282
you won't have anything to worry
about any more.

171
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,990
You'll be covered and legal...
And more importantly,

172
00:17:15,073 --> 00:17:16,157
I'll get you a card.

173
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,823
I have a contract
with the Western hysteria ...

174
00:17:18,032 --> 00:17:19,365
You can live there...

175
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:23,532
You're the greatest mystery
of nature I've ever come across...

176
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:12,240
John...

177
00:18:21,323 --> 00:18:22,948
I got picked up in a Eugenics raid.

178
00:18:23,157 --> 00:18:24,573
I shot a carrier...

179
00:18:25,823 --> 00:18:31,823
It could have gone very badly...
A human woman doctor saved me.

180
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:35,865
She offered me a job
and legal housing...

181
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:37,407
Accept it...

182
00:18:37,615 --> 00:18:39,407
As a guinea pig...

183
00:18:39,657 --> 00:18:43,657
Apparently my body
is only three months old,

184
00:18:43,907 --> 00:18:46,865
and my organs aren't
in the right place...

185
00:18:47,198 --> 00:18:52,240
Not in the right place,
according to whose criteria?

186
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:55,115
You see that pyramid monument...

187
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:58,282
Do you think it's in its right place?

188
00:18:58,282 --> 00:19:01,240
And me? Do you think I am?

189
00:19:03,032 --> 00:19:06,490
There's something important
you should know.

190
00:19:07,157 --> 00:19:11,990
This planet is rejecting me,
Jill...This atmosphere,

191
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,740
this oxygen, it's burning me up...

192
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,948
I have to take care
of you before it's too late.

193
00:19:22,281 --> 00:19:27,198
I'm getting old, Jill,
I've been around for centuries...

194
00:19:27,281 --> 00:19:29,906
I'm confused

195
00:20:34,365 --> 00:20:35,698
Oh... My God...

196
00:20:38,365 --> 00:20:39,573
Jesus!

197
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:42,448
This one's empty!

198
00:20:54,948 --> 00:20:57,198
Restricted area.

199
00:22:36,031 --> 00:22:38,948
... A flying pyramid,
a serial killer on the loose

200
00:22:39,198 --> 00:22:41,323
and now a chunk
of prison falling from the sky.

201
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:44,781
Is someone out to sabotage
my political career or what?

202
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:47,781
It's like in one of those
Greek tragedies, Senator,

203
00:22:48,031 --> 00:22:49,573
all the elements will fall into place...

204
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:51,948
What are you doing here,
Inspector FROEBE?

205
00:22:53,698 --> 00:22:57,614
I'm looking for three
of my men who have disappeared.

206
00:22:58,031 --> 00:22:59,948
Your serial killer again?

207
00:23:00,198 --> 00:23:01,948
Don't think so.

208
00:23:02,448 --> 00:23:04,864
Here. A gift for you.

209
00:23:05,031 --> 00:23:06,281
What is it?

210
00:23:06,698 --> 00:23:08,031
You should know better than me.

211
00:23:08,239 --> 00:23:10,781
Give me that!
This is way out of your league.

212
00:23:10,906 --> 00:23:14,531
I haven't found
the man who goes with this...

213
00:23:32,489 --> 00:23:41,948
"Remember...
Remember the sight we saw, my soul,

214
00:23:42,156 --> 00:23:45,948
that beautiful soft summer morning..."

215
00:23:49,656 --> 00:23:54,239
"...round a turning in the path..."

216
00:23:54,323 --> 00:23:55,989
Thank you...

217
00:23:56,864 --> 00:24:04,531
..."a disgusting carcass
on a bed scattered with stones,

218
00:24:06,823 --> 00:24:11,406
its legs in the air like
a woman in heat..."

219
00:24:53,323 --> 00:24:56,948
"Remember the sight we saw, my soul,

220
00:24:56,989 --> 00:25:01,823
that beautiful soft summer morning...

221
00:25:02,198 --> 00:25:05,323
round a turning in the path,

222
00:25:05,531 --> 00:25:11,198
a disgusting carcass
on a bed scattered with stones,

223
00:25:12,573 --> 00:25:19,864
its legs in the air like a woman
in heat..."

224
00:25:22,948 --> 00:25:29,198
"... like a fountain
with its rhythmical sobs.

225
00:25:30,364 --> 00:25:33,323
I can hear it clearly flowing
with a long,

226
00:25:33,614 --> 00:25:39,114
murmuring sound, but I touch my body
in vain to find the wound..."

227
00:25:43,031 --> 00:25:47,739
"...I am the vampire of my own heart,

228
00:25:48,864 --> 00:25:54,323
One of the great outcasts condemned
to eternal laughter

229
00:25:54,531 --> 00:25:57,989
who can no longer smile...".

230
00:26:00,198 --> 00:26:06,364
Am I dead? I must be dead.

231
00:26:07,531 --> 00:26:09,239
And you...

232
00:26:10,448 --> 00:26:13,114
I know you,
you are from Hierakonopolis.

233
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:14,864
The god of the heavens.

234
00:26:15,114 --> 00:26:19,864
I'm flattered, Nikopol,
wretched human.

235
00:26:20,072 --> 00:26:22,322
...Anubis can't be far away?

236
00:26:22,531 --> 00:26:24,697
The guardian of the tombs...
The god of the dead...

237
00:26:24,864 --> 00:26:26,989
Don't ever speak
that jackal's name again,

238
00:26:27,197 --> 00:26:31,197
you understand? Only my name...
Only me...

239
00:26:31,697 --> 00:26:33,572
OK.. OK...

240
00:26:36,656 --> 00:26:40,614
My leg!... Where is my leg?

241
00:26:40,781 --> 00:26:43,281
You can see you're not dead...

242
00:26:43,531 --> 00:26:45,281
The dead don't feel pain...

243
00:26:45,572 --> 00:26:47,447
The dead don't bleed either.

244
00:26:47,281 --> 00:26:54,239
Yeah,
I'm alive and I'm bleeding like a pig.

245
00:27:00,947 --> 00:27:04,489
Listen carefully, I won't say it twice.

246
00:27:04,697 --> 00:27:06,364
For two of your days now,

247
00:27:06,572 --> 00:27:08,489
I have been looking for a host body,

248
00:27:08,739 --> 00:27:13,239
for reasons that go far beyond any
human concerns.

249
00:27:13,406 --> 00:27:17,864
I need a body
to welcome me and serve me.

250
00:27:18,031 --> 00:27:21,864
You... You seem to be suitable.

251
00:27:22,156 --> 00:27:27,364
I've tested seven humans before you
and rejected them all... But you,

252
00:27:27,531 --> 00:27:29,614
your body is clean.
You come from the past...

253
00:27:30,572 --> 00:27:32,947
Thirty years of hibernation...

254
00:27:33,156 --> 00:27:39,031
Your body won't reject me.
We are compatible.

255
00:27:41,489 --> 00:27:46,322
What year is it? Who set me free?

256
00:27:46,572 --> 00:27:56,364
2095 after your Jesus Christ.
Your release is an accidental escape.

257
00:27:56,572 --> 00:28:01,364
I was supposed to be let out in 2096.

258
00:28:02,656 --> 00:28:07,114
I was released a year ahead
of schedule.

259
00:28:07,406 --> 00:28:12,197
I've gained a year
but Iost a leg. Fuck!

260
00:28:12,572 --> 00:28:15,239
Forget the old one...

261
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,906
Here's a new one.

262
00:28:28,697 --> 00:28:32,322
Yes... Thank you for calling.

263
00:28:33,531 --> 00:28:37,031
That was the forensic scientist
from Globus...

264
00:28:37,239 --> 00:28:38,406
And?

265
00:28:38,572 --> 00:28:40,739
The leg has been identified.

266
00:28:40,906 --> 00:28:42,197
And?

267
00:28:42,364 --> 00:28:47,281
Well... it belongs to... Nikopol.

268
00:29:05,822 --> 00:29:07,281
Perfect

269
00:29:10,031 --> 00:29:15,614
There's no way.
This thing weighs a ton.

270
00:29:16,822 --> 00:29:18,989
I'll never be able to move.

271
00:29:19,447 --> 00:29:24,572
That's right.
Without me you won't be able to move.

272
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,406
And by the way,

273
00:29:26,614 --> 00:29:32,114
from now on you won't be able
to do much of anything without me...

274
00:29:32,281 --> 00:29:33,989
I accept that I'm not dead now.

275
00:29:34,281 --> 00:29:39,239
But I hope I'm dreaming this.
Please God let this be a nightmare.

276
00:29:38,697 --> 00:29:41,072
Let this all be a nightmare...

277
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:44,197
You believe in God?

278
00:29:44,489 --> 00:29:47,030
I don't even have that to fall back on.

279
00:29:47,239 --> 00:29:52,239
I suggest you believe in me, Nikopol...

280
00:29:52,655 --> 00:29:54,280
Do I have a choice?

281
00:29:54,489 --> 00:29:56,947
I'm afraid not.

282
00:30:03,739 --> 00:30:07,322
Now, rise and walk.

283
00:30:26,197 --> 00:30:30,572
I've relinquished control, Nikopol,
you can have a bit of autonomy now.

284
00:30:30,739 --> 00:30:35,114
I want you to know that everything
is going perfectly well.

285
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,489
Your body is very comfortable
and tolerates me beautifully...

286
00:30:39,697 --> 00:30:44,447
And above all you're most elegant.

287
00:30:44,572 --> 00:30:46,114
Are you fucking kidding me?

288
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:53,655
Elegant, famous and subversive.
Just what I like ...

289
00:30:54,364 --> 00:30:57,322
It seems you're the instigator
of all this fighting

290
00:30:57,614 --> 00:30:59,530
that's been going on without you...

291
00:30:59,822 --> 00:31:03,405
Not bad for a human...

292
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:17,405
Would it be too much to ask
for just a bit more autonomy?

293
00:31:20,447 --> 00:31:22,239
I'd like to choose my own clothes,

294
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:24,739
with the Iittle free
will I have left...

295
00:31:26,864 --> 00:31:33,447
Your happiness is my priority,
Nikopol, Mr. Free spirit.

296
00:31:55,405 --> 00:31:57,697
How is Doctor Elma Turner?

297
00:31:57,864 --> 00:31:59,155
Never been better.

298
00:31:59,155 --> 00:32:03,447
Welcome to the Western Hysteria Hotel.
39th floor. Room 12.

299
00:32:03,822 --> 00:32:05,989
Any friend of Dr Turner's
is a friend of mine.

300
00:33:24,613 --> 00:33:27,197
Por ti Ketro...

301
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:32,905
That's for me?... Thanks...

302
00:33:34,697 --> 00:33:35,572
What's your name?

303
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,197
Willy... Ketarakado... Willy...

304
00:33:37,405 --> 00:33:44,363
Willy? OK, I'll call you Willy.
And you can call me Jill...

305
00:33:46,363 --> 00:33:52,655
Temperature fourty four degrees

306
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:56,530
Number of teeth: thirty seven unit,
thirty seven

307
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,405
No mammal dental blades,
unknown Buccal profile unknown...

308
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:03,530
Thank you Jill now you can make
the food test.

309
00:34:31,738 --> 00:34:33,280
...with a list that's getting longer.

310
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,072
Eight victims, all male,

311
00:34:39,613 --> 00:34:40,655
This just in,

312
00:34:40,822 --> 00:34:43,738
Senator ALLGOOD has announced
that he will be on the Zeppelin

313
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:46,363
when the scientific delegation
and leading

314
00:34:46,572 --> 00:34:48,322
Egyptologists make another attempt

315
00:34:48,572 --> 00:34:51,780
to contact the inhabitants
of the Pyramid...

316
00:34:52,072 --> 00:34:53,780
...the hydrometer rate
is down today in

317
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,530
Brooklyn for the fourth day running.

318
00:34:55,738 --> 00:34:59,238
On INTRUSION, however, no change.
Snow, ice,

319
00:34:59,405 --> 00:35:01,780
temperature 23 below freezing...

320
00:35:01,947 --> 00:35:04,238
Twelve attempted break-ins
into lNTRUSlON have been

321
00:35:04,488 --> 00:35:07,363
reported: there are no survivors.

322
00:35:07,613 --> 00:35:10,613
Do not approach the Central Park area.

323
00:35:13,905 --> 00:35:21,030
DOWN! ... DOWN! ... DOWN!
...EVERY BODY DOWN!

324
00:36:25,738 --> 00:36:29,238
Aber od neb aber, Bastet?
Are we cheating or not, Bastet?

325
00:36:29,447 --> 00:36:33,655
Aber, Anubis,aber .
We're cheating,Anubis, we're cheating

326
00:36:45,155 --> 00:36:47,863
You don't understand? Nikopol is alive!

327
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:50,446
Maybe not.
It was reported that He was shot

328
00:36:50,863 --> 00:36:52,321
by a department store security guard

329
00:36:52,488 --> 00:36:57,030
and fell a hundred meters...
But they couldn't find the body.

330
00:36:57,238 --> 00:36:59,321
Are you telling me the man can fly?

331
00:36:59,363 --> 00:37:01,446
I can put you on to Huxley,
Froebe's right hand man.

332
00:37:01,738 --> 00:37:02,530
He's in charge of...

333
00:37:02,613 --> 00:37:06,071
That's OK, Jonas. Thanks.
You can leave us now...

334
00:37:07,405 --> 00:37:10,530
Right. Get the hell out
of here! Beat it!

335
00:37:11,113 --> 00:37:12,530
He knows everything.

336
00:37:12,738 --> 00:37:14,863
I know he knows everything,

337
00:37:14,863 --> 00:37:17,696
and his phenomenal memory
is stuffed with enough evidence

338
00:37:18,155 --> 00:37:21,030
concerning your late father's
financial dealings

339
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,571
and his illegal experiments
on alien populations to cause EUGENlCS

340
00:37:24,571 --> 00:37:26,821
some very serious problems...

341
00:37:27,238 --> 00:37:28,780
I am aware of that.

342
00:37:29,446 --> 00:37:33,863
Up until now we've only had the spirit
of Nikopol to deal with,

343
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:36,405
but now we have him in flesh and blood.

344
00:37:36,613 --> 00:37:39,071
No one's ever come back from GLOBUS.

345
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:44,238
Well, HE has. Why wasn't he executed
30 years ago, anyway?

346
00:37:44,488 --> 00:37:48,446
Are you crazy?... Are you crazy?

347
00:37:48,738 --> 00:37:52,155
To make a hero out of him,
a martyr to their lousy revolution?

348
00:37:52,363 --> 00:37:55,821
What do you want, riots,
assassination?!

349
00:38:08,071 --> 00:38:10,655
It is the last prototype
of the "hunter" version.

350
00:38:10,905 --> 00:38:13,488
Fast, ferocious and totally illegal.

351
00:38:13,696 --> 00:38:16,155
He'll be quicker
than Froebe and his men.

352
00:38:16,446 --> 00:38:17,030
Are you sure?

353
00:38:17,321 --> 00:38:23,113
No, but it's the only solution...
Apart from your "protege".

354
00:38:23,363 --> 00:38:28,321
No, not him...
Let's try this one first.

355
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:31,530
Come in!

356
00:38:32,655 --> 00:38:34,071
You're early!

357
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,196
We have no time to lose

358
00:38:36,738 --> 00:38:39,655
Is he ready?
Have you re-activated him yet?

359
00:38:38,863 --> 00:38:41,405
No. I'll need about an hour.

360
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,488
I wanted to make sure you really
wanted him.

361
00:38:45,738 --> 00:38:47,071
We do.

362
00:38:47,571 --> 00:38:48,821
OK.

363
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:16,030
What's this! What happened?

364
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:21,488
Nothing of any importance,
really, nothing.

365
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:27,030
Do you like women?

366
00:39:28,321 --> 00:39:29,530
Women?

367
00:39:29,946 --> 00:39:32,405
Women...

368
00:39:32,613 --> 00:39:38,280
My most beautiful and most important
creation on this planet...

369
00:39:40,905 --> 00:39:44,363
Your story doesn't make much sense...

370
00:39:45,238 --> 00:39:50,030
You're looking for a blue-haired girl
with white skin...

371
00:39:50,863 --> 00:39:55,488
What's this all about, and,
how do you know she comes here?

372
00:39:55,696 --> 00:39:59,946
In the same way that I knew
I'd find her on planet Earth,

373
00:39:59,946 --> 00:40:01,030
in New York City...

374
00:40:01,405 --> 00:40:05,946
Intuition, Nikopol,
the intuition of the gods...

375
00:40:06,155 --> 00:40:11,071
So. What's so special about her
that warrants such a display of talents?

376
00:40:11,155 --> 00:40:14,571
Is she Miss Universe or what?

377
00:40:15,738 --> 00:40:21,571
You don't think I've come all this way
for a mere human being, do you?

378
00:40:28,904 --> 00:40:31,113
Now I know more about you...

379
00:40:35,071 --> 00:40:37,404
Why are you doing all this for me?

380
00:40:38,488 --> 00:40:40,571
It's a political and social fight.

381
00:40:41,029 --> 00:40:43,404
My Spirit of Nikopol coming out.

382
00:40:44,154 --> 00:40:46,488
Besides, your case interests me...

383
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:49,946
I think you like me...

384
00:40:53,529 --> 00:40:55,738
Isn't that what you were thinking?

385
00:40:58,196 --> 00:40:59,488
You could say that.

386
00:41:00,154 --> 00:41:01,613
How did you guess?

387
00:41:02,446 --> 00:41:04,446
Do you read minds too?

388
00:41:04,696 --> 00:41:05,654
You could say that...

389
00:41:05,738 --> 00:41:09,446
It's true, I do like you
and I feel close to you, Jill,

390
00:41:09,654 --> 00:41:12,279
whoever you are...
Mutant or whatever...

391
00:41:12,404 --> 00:41:14,404
Although you are beginning
to scare me.

392
00:41:14,904 --> 00:41:16,446
Let's try a little experiment.

393
00:41:16,654 --> 00:41:18,738
To test this talent of yours...

394
00:41:18,904 --> 00:41:21,779
I'm going to think of a question
and you're going to answer. Ready?

395
00:41:22,321 --> 00:41:23,488
Ready.

396
00:41:25,238 --> 00:41:27,196
I've asked the question.

397
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:32,488
You want to know
if I've started testing

398
00:41:32,696 --> 00:41:35,029
the foods you prescribed for me,

399
00:41:35,196 --> 00:41:36,863
if I took a blood
test three hours later and

400
00:41:37,154 --> 00:41:39,404
if I took ... notes.

401
00:41:40,779 --> 00:41:43,154
Answer: Yes!

402
00:41:43,363 --> 00:41:46,529
I did everything I was supposed to do,
and I found everything absolutely

403
00:41:46,738 --> 00:41:50,446
delicious...
I'm a professional guinea pig.

404
00:41:50,988 --> 00:41:52,488
Have you tasted everything?

405
00:41:52,654 --> 00:41:54,571
For dinner, yes. I ate it all.

406
00:41:54,904 --> 00:41:58,696
And you ate everything at once?
In the prescribed quantities?

407
00:41:58,946 --> 00:42:03,488
I weighed everything.
I just changed a couple of the recipes.

408
00:42:03,696 --> 00:42:05,113
I didn't have anything to cook with

409
00:42:05,363 --> 00:42:10,488
so I ate the fish called monkfish raw
and the lamb too.

410
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:13,613
They're not bad together.

411
00:42:13,821 --> 00:42:14,654
How many meals do you have a day?

412
00:42:15,113 --> 00:42:15,779
Two a week.

413
00:43:10,363 --> 00:43:12,029
She's not bad.

414
00:43:13,321 --> 00:43:17,821
Not surprising, you idiot.
She's the one.

415
00:44:01,779 --> 00:44:03,029
John...

416
00:44:18,987 --> 00:44:20,987
Come Jill, come...

417
00:44:24,446 --> 00:44:28,321
You'll be my last
and my most beautiful Intrusion...

418
00:44:28,529 --> 00:44:31,154
Listen carefully...

419
00:44:31,321 --> 00:44:34,279
For thousands of Earth years I've been

420
00:44:34,321 --> 00:44:38,696
introducing people into
the four corners of the galaxy...

421
00:44:39,071 --> 00:44:43,279
People misplaced by the vagaries
of the Universe...

422
00:44:43,279 --> 00:44:49,571
You're a misplaced person, Jill...
And I'll never know your origins...

423
00:44:49,612 --> 00:44:52,779
You appeared deep in the heart
of INTRUSION about three months ago...

424
00:44:52,987 --> 00:44:56,237
That's where I took charge of you...

425
00:44:56,446 --> 00:45:00,112
The blue pills stop your past
from re-emerging

426
00:45:00,362 --> 00:45:02,987
and let the present... invade you.

427
00:45:03,779 --> 00:45:06,279
Your metamorphosis is on the verge
of completion...

428
00:45:06,196 --> 00:45:10,946
From now on your place
is on this planet...

429
00:45:11,612 --> 00:45:15,446
What about you? Aren't you staying?

430
00:45:15,654 --> 00:45:17,571
I'm a passer at the end of his cycle.

431
00:45:19,237 --> 00:45:21,154
I'm already dreaming of a void...

432
00:45:21,904 --> 00:45:22,737
I'm afraid...

433
00:45:22,946 --> 00:45:25,071
Afraid of what?

434
00:45:27,654 --> 00:45:29,946
...of becoming human.

435
00:45:31,987 --> 00:45:35,862
Tell me about your job
with Doctor Elma Turner

436
00:45:46,571 --> 00:45:48,071
Can I buy you a drink?

437
00:45:48,529 --> 00:45:50,612
Don't you think I have enough already?

438
00:45:50,404 --> 00:45:53,987
Well, I don't see any cognac,
or sake...

439
00:45:54,362 --> 00:45:56,612
Tequila... Slivovitsa...

440
00:45:56,779 --> 00:45:58,529
I'm working. Do you mind?

441
00:46:00,112 --> 00:46:04,279
A vodka. Make it a Tarkovskaia,
please.

442
00:46:07,029 --> 00:46:10,654
I like your hair. It's very nice.

443
00:46:10,946 --> 00:46:15,987
It goes very well with... white skin...

444
00:46:20,904 --> 00:46:22,821
Is it a new thing in make-up?

445
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:26,071
Kabuki style maybe?
You must be an actress.

446
00:46:27,904 --> 00:46:31,279
You're expecting something from me...

447
00:46:32,779 --> 00:46:34,946
The answer is No.

448
00:46:40,071 --> 00:46:43,821
You're going to need someone
to take you home.

449
00:46:47,904 --> 00:46:50,571
What makes you think that?

450
00:46:50,862 --> 00:46:54,404
You have no other choice.

451
00:47:00,529 --> 00:47:02,654
One for the road.

452
00:47:23,862 --> 00:47:27,279
I like... this one.

453
00:47:28,195 --> 00:47:31,029
How about you, young lady?

454
00:47:32,529 --> 00:47:35,445
We are going to get along fine.

455
00:47:35,654 --> 00:47:39,112
It's very important
to have the same tastes..

456
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,154
No!

457
00:47:46,695 --> 00:47:49,945
We've got more important things
to do than fight each other...

458
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:13,279
Address?... Western Hysteria Hotel...

459
00:48:20,612 --> 00:48:26,862
You are Inspector John Emerson Huxley
and you have a black box in your brain.

460
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:29,320
Give it to me, please.

461
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:33,404
Or I'll have to go in and take it...

462
00:48:56,612 --> 00:49:01,612
It goes very well with...white skin...

463
00:49:48,237 --> 00:49:49,945
I don't have a room.

464
00:50:02,904 --> 00:50:03,904
Which Level are you from?

465
00:50:04,112 --> 00:50:06,070
I'm above levels...

466
00:50:06,154 --> 00:50:10,820
This is Level 2 and the hotel's full.

467
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:16,570
The hotel maybe... but your bed is not.

468
00:50:22,112 --> 00:50:23,779
Ladies first...

469
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:10,487
Control, Miss. Your papers.

470
00:53:10,737 --> 00:53:12,195
My papers?

471
00:53:12,403 --> 00:53:13,653
Your card if you prefer.

472
00:53:23,945 --> 00:53:28,695
Thank you, Miss.
Do you have any weapons,

473
00:53:28,903 --> 00:53:31,945
explosives...
Any history of violent conduct?

474
00:53:32,278 --> 00:53:34,570
I hate violence.

475
00:53:34,737 --> 00:53:36,653
Are you comfortable here?

476
00:53:36,945 --> 00:53:39,403
Yes, fine.

477
00:53:42,112 --> 00:53:48,403
Yes... I hate violence but I do like
to caress myself with bird feathers...

478
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:51,737
preferably black ones.

479
00:53:53,320 --> 00:54:00,028
It's a bit small isn't it?
Don't you have a bathroom?

480
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:04,820
No. No bathroom.

481
00:54:05,278 --> 00:54:09,612
I've decided never to wash again. Ever!

482
00:54:36,903 --> 00:54:43,320
Who are you? This is my bathroom!
What are you doing in my bathroom?

483
00:54:48,195 --> 00:54:50,403
Who are you?

484
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:53,070
We had a drink together last night.

485
00:54:53,445 --> 00:54:55,945
You had several, in fact...
it's not surprising you can't remember.

486
00:54:56,195 --> 00:54:58,945
Alcohol has no effect on me.

487
00:54:59,236 --> 00:55:01,820
What's happening here?
What about the door?

488
00:55:01,861 --> 00:55:06,903
That door wasn't there a moment ago.
Did you do that?

489
00:55:07,361 --> 00:55:09,236
I'm no carpenter.

490
00:55:09,486 --> 00:55:12,070
Be careful...Those things can go off
all by themselves.

491
00:55:12,278 --> 00:55:14,070
Shut up, human!

492
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:20,486
What happened last night?
What did you do to my body?

493
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:24,986
So?

494
00:55:27,653 --> 00:55:30,028
What did I do to your body?...

495
00:55:31,111 --> 00:55:35,445
We had sexual intercourse...
You and I...

496
00:55:35,611 --> 00:55:38,486
Well...
Maybe not just the two of us alone...

497
00:55:38,695 --> 00:55:41,611
What do you mean by
"sexual intercourse"?

498
00:55:41,861 --> 00:55:44,153
At times last night you gave
the impression

499
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,695
you knew perfectly well...

500
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:49,820
I wi...

501
00:55:51,778 --> 00:55:54,153
I could tell you the truth...

502
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,570
What truth?

503
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:50,486
Bloody fuckin'god...
What did you make me do?

504
00:56:56,278 --> 00:56:57,611
Fuck you!!!

505
00:57:00,153 --> 00:57:02,028
What are we waiting for?

506
00:57:02,570 --> 00:57:05,278
The answers
to the questions I asked him.

507
00:57:06,611 --> 00:57:08,986
He can't talk anymore,

508
00:57:09,153 --> 00:57:14,986
but we may be able to piece together
recent events from his subconscious.

509
00:57:15,736 --> 00:57:18,486
Well can he be... repaired?

510
00:57:18,861 --> 00:57:20,570
He can be treated.

511
00:57:30,653 --> 00:57:31,945
A Dayak?!

512
00:57:32,945 --> 00:57:38,861
A fake. A replica
of a Dayak, humanized.

513
00:57:39,111 --> 00:57:46,194
We found some synthetic red epidermis
signed EUGENICS under his fingernails.

514
00:57:49,569 --> 00:57:51,111
Leave us now.

515
00:57:54,486 --> 00:57:55,861
Rape...

516
00:57:56,903 --> 00:57:58,236
Rape?

517
00:58:04,236 --> 00:58:06,361
You made me commit rape.

518
00:58:06,528 --> 00:58:10,903
She consented. We, Gods,
have physical appetites, you know...

519
00:58:11,069 --> 00:58:15,611
Which we have more than aptly
demonstrated for thousands of years...

520
00:58:15,903 --> 00:58:18,528
You really are a piece of shit.

521
00:58:18,736 --> 00:58:21,903
You think everything
is yours for the taking.

522
00:58:22,069 --> 00:58:25,361
My body, that girl's body,
all the others you murdered...

523
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:29,486
We'll do it your way next time,
if you wish...

524
00:58:29,486 --> 00:58:32,486
Next time? Do what my way?

525
00:58:32,778 --> 00:58:34,986
Next time we make love to her.

526
00:58:35,319 --> 00:58:39,944
We must make love again with that...
young lady...

527
00:58:40,736 --> 00:58:42,111
No way!

528
00:58:42,278 --> 00:58:44,111
Don't you like her?

529
00:58:46,194 --> 00:58:50,653
I'm not sharing my body anymore,
is that clear?

530
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:53,986
Not for fucking or for anything else.

531
00:58:54,236 --> 00:59:00,528
That's the end of the line.
You go your way, I'll go mine!

532
00:59:00,861 --> 00:59:03,028
Nikopol, Nikopol...

533
00:59:03,361 --> 00:59:06,528
You're talking
as if you had the choice.

534
00:59:06,569 --> 00:59:10,528
You can walk perfectly
normally if I want you to...

535
00:59:12,653 --> 00:59:15,153
But if I don't...

536
00:59:20,153 --> 00:59:22,611
Don't forget this either...

537
00:59:41,819 --> 00:59:43,319
Fuck you!

538
00:59:43,528 --> 00:59:49,028
Right, but let's fuck her again first.

539
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:51,694
Can you describe him?

540
00:59:51,944 --> 00:59:57,486
Rather average...
from what I can remember...

541
00:59:57,653 --> 00:59:58,736
Human looking...

542
00:59:58,903 --> 01:00:03,194
What about his... penis?
Human looking too?

543
01:00:04,194 --> 01:00:07,944
Have you already had relations
of this nature before?

544
01:00:08,236 --> 01:00:13,903
Relations? Human?... Social?...

545
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:16,319
Sexual.

546
01:00:17,778 --> 01:00:19,278
Intercourse...

547
01:00:19,486 --> 01:00:22,361
I think you've experienced
it but you don't remember...

548
01:00:22,611 --> 01:00:23,694
The drugs... The pills...

549
01:00:23,861 --> 01:00:26,611
I don't know who's treating you
but it shows...

550
01:00:27,153 --> 01:00:30,486
Even your organs are positioning
themselves correctly.

551
01:00:35,111 --> 01:00:36,778
Thank you for trusting me, Jill...

552
01:00:36,986 --> 01:00:40,944
I trust John... Only John.

553
01:00:41,153 --> 01:00:44,778
Are you testing me? Is that it?

554
01:00:48,236 --> 01:00:52,153
That's him, I recognize him!

555
01:00:53,861 --> 01:00:56,278
And that is the girl...

556
01:00:57,569 --> 01:00:59,403
This is all that we've kept of her.

557
01:00:59,653 --> 01:01:01,611
Her lachrymal secretions.

558
01:01:01,903 --> 01:01:03,444
That should be enough.

559
01:01:03,903 --> 01:01:05,069
This kind of DAYAK

560
01:01:05,236 --> 01:01:07,528
has olfactory capabilities 500 times
superior to ours.

561
01:01:09,111 --> 01:01:13,111
My favorite moving molecular lab.

562
01:01:14,652 --> 01:01:16,736
He's a real hunter...

563
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:09,319
You taste good.

564
01:05:09,527 --> 01:05:13,527
I'm proud of myself
for having found you.

565
01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:18,277
You have to tell me where I can find
the one who's with you.

566
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:20,235
I don't know who you're talking about.

567
01:05:20,694 --> 01:05:24,360
You'd better know who
I'm talking about.

568
01:07:05,444 --> 01:07:10,027
Shh...
Jill has been through some really

569
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:14,652
difficult moments...
I've had to erase them from her memory.

570
01:07:14,694 --> 01:07:20,360
We must protect her... And love her...
We must IMPREGNATE her!

571
01:07:21,235 --> 01:07:23,360
So that's it?...

572
01:07:23,527 --> 01:07:27,444
Can I count on you, Nikopol?

573
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:31,944
I knew I could ...

574
01:07:54,069 --> 01:07:57,069
"Ceaselessly
by my side moves the Demon;

575
01:07:57,360 --> 01:08:01,110
He swims around me
like impalpable air;

576
01:08:01,569 --> 01:08:04,902
I swallow and feel it burn my lungs

577
01:08:05,069 --> 01:08:08,444
And fill them
with eternal desire and guilt..."

578
01:08:08,610 --> 01:08:10,610
Still already here?

579
01:08:13,902 --> 01:08:16,527
You really don't
have anywhere else to go?

580
01:08:16,568 --> 01:08:19,985
I really don't have the choice...
I only have you ...

581
01:08:20,693 --> 01:08:22,277
Are you feeling alright?

582
01:08:22,902 --> 01:08:24,985
Shouldn't I be?

583
01:08:27,027 --> 01:08:28,402
Been in a fight?

584
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:31,985
There's a blank in my memory...

585
01:08:38,027 --> 01:08:41,193
Maybe you're the one who hit me!

586
01:08:43,610 --> 01:08:46,277
Why did you spend thirty years
in hibernation?

587
01:08:46,485 --> 01:08:48,443
Afraid of growing older?

588
01:08:48,693 --> 01:08:50,235
How do you know that?

589
01:08:50,485 --> 01:08:52,568
I can mind read a bit.

590
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:55,277
But yours...
I don't understand a thing.

591
01:08:55,485 --> 01:08:58,943
I know you raped me last night.

592
01:08:59,193 --> 01:09:00,568
But I can't find
the memory in your mind.

593
01:09:00,735 --> 01:09:04,068
To be quite honest,
it's not very clear for me either.

594
01:09:04,068 --> 01:09:06,860
We should do it again
and try to understand...

595
01:09:07,443 --> 01:09:08,777
You owe me that.

596
01:09:08,985 --> 01:09:13,902
I was sentenced to hibernation
for trying to protect people like you.

597
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:17,693
No one is like me.

598
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:20,235
I'll go along with that...

599
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:26,152
Well, what do you read in my mind now?

600
01:09:29,818 --> 01:09:32,360
OK. I'll buy you a drink.

601
01:09:32,443 --> 01:09:33,652
I'd love a bottle of Bordeaux...
It's been ages...

602
01:09:33,902 --> 01:09:35,568
Never heard of it.

603
01:09:38,652 --> 01:09:42,360
You've travelled in space and time.

604
01:09:42,652 --> 01:09:45,402
You're colder than a block of ice
and it suits you so fine.

605
01:09:45,443 --> 01:09:48,152
Who are You?

606
01:09:48,568 --> 01:09:52,235
I thing you like me
What are you doing to me?

607
01:09:52,443 --> 01:09:56,193
To me Who are you?

608
01:09:56,443 --> 01:09:59,027
I'm confused

609
01:09:59,277 --> 01:10:01,652
I can't remenber anything

610
01:10:01,818 --> 01:10:05,693
I'm a guinea pig. A human woman

611
01:10:05,902 --> 01:10:08,402
You can call me Jill

612
01:10:08,777 --> 01:10:11,985
You're expecting something from me

613
01:10:12,152 --> 01:10:15,610
The answer is no

614
01:10:16,568 --> 01:10:19,152
The answer is no

615
01:10:19,818 --> 01:10:22,027
Aaah! It's cold!

616
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:26,277
Sorry, it's my leg.
I should have warned you...

617
01:10:27,027 --> 01:10:31,735
It's a bit icy, of course.
Not much blood circulation down there.

618
01:10:42,735 --> 01:10:46,152
It would be a shame
to Iet a few degrees...of temp...

619
01:10:46,318 --> 01:10:48,943
temperature interrupt us...

620
01:10:51,777 --> 01:10:55,027
Sorry Jill... Sorry...

621
01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:17,902
Calm down, Jill... Calm down.

622
01:11:37,110 --> 01:11:43,360
Something in the air's changed since
last time Anubis, don't you find

623
01:12:39,235 --> 01:12:40,693
John! I'm scared!

624
01:12:41,610 --> 01:12:45,068
John! Please come back!

625
01:12:44,235 --> 01:12:45,568
I'm here Jill!

626
01:12:49,401 --> 01:12:52,193
It's too dangerous to cross over now.

627
01:12:52,568 --> 01:12:55,026
It's not ready yet,
and you aren't either.

628
01:12:55,276 --> 01:12:57,193
Tomorrow, I hope.

629
01:12:59,485 --> 01:13:02,443
INTRUSION is a gateway which
will close behind me,

630
01:13:02,693 --> 01:13:04,818
and disappear with me...

631
01:13:05,526 --> 01:13:09,776
It will reappear somewhere else,
other passers will come,

632
01:13:09,985 --> 01:13:12,943
but you'll be the last creature
to use it.

633
01:13:13,443 --> 01:13:14,360
John...

634
01:13:14,568 --> 01:13:15,818
Yes?

635
01:13:17,526 --> 01:13:19,193
I've met someone.

636
01:13:19,443 --> 01:13:23,443
Good... Your life
as an earth dweller has begun.

637
01:13:23,651 --> 01:13:25,860
Meeting humans, feeling desire...

638
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:27,401
Being in love...

639
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:31,443
One of the most beautiful feelings
you'll experience here...

640
01:13:31,610 --> 01:13:34,235
But I love you. You first!

641
01:13:34,443 --> 01:13:37,860
Love is very different here...

642
01:13:38,110 --> 01:13:40,235
What should I do?

643
01:13:40,651 --> 01:13:45,651
Cry... Whenever you feel the need,
just cry...

644
01:13:48,401 --> 01:13:50,026
Where is she?

645
01:13:51,026 --> 01:13:52,693
Where the fuck is she?!

646
01:13:52,901 --> 01:13:54,610
I already told you.
She went for a walk.

647
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:56,360
You have to understand her...

648
01:13:56,568 --> 01:13:59,276
But you're right, NlKOPOL,
you're right to want to hurt me,

649
01:13:59,526 --> 01:14:03,693
even if I don't feel a thing...
Hit me again, harder.

650
01:14:04,110 --> 01:14:08,943
You piece of shit.
Your objectives are shit,

651
01:14:09,235 --> 01:14:11,151
your filthy rapist god ambitions
are shit!!

652
01:14:12,276 --> 01:14:13,776
You're full of shit!

653
01:14:13,985 --> 01:14:18,235
Coming from a human, remarks like
that don't carry much weight.

654
01:14:18,401 --> 01:14:23,235
You're damaging that girl...
You're damaging Jill!

655
01:14:23,443 --> 01:14:25,651
You're destroying something
really beautiful.

656
01:14:25,860 --> 01:14:27,485
You don't destroy what you love.

657
01:14:28,693 --> 01:14:30,568
You shouldn't have let her go...

658
01:14:30,776 --> 01:14:32,693
She'll be back...

659
01:14:32,735 --> 01:14:35,651
We still have to make love
to her again...

660
01:14:35,901 --> 01:14:38,776
It isn't over yet...

661
01:14:39,318 --> 01:14:42,276
All right, the impregnation!

662
01:14:42,526 --> 01:14:44,401
I nearly forgot that minor detail.

663
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:47,901
What is this obsession of yours?

664
01:14:48,110 --> 01:14:52,943
An obsession about how
little time I have left.

665
01:14:53,735 --> 01:14:56,360
I really feel for you...

666
01:14:58,443 --> 01:15:00,026
My name is Doctor Elma Turner...

667
01:15:00,276 --> 01:15:01,360
I'm looking for one of my patients.

668
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:04,235
It's been a long time since anybody's
come in here looking to be cured.

669
01:15:04,526 --> 01:15:07,860
Her name is Jill.
She told me she was a regular here.

670
01:15:08,235 --> 01:15:11,151
You must know her...
White skin, blue hair...

671
01:15:11,401 --> 01:15:15,109
I don't know any humans,
personally, that is.

672
01:15:15,318 --> 01:15:17,109
Jill isn't really human...

673
01:15:17,359 --> 01:15:19,776
How much do you know?

674
01:15:20,359 --> 01:15:21,443
You must be John?

675
01:15:21,609 --> 01:15:23,318
And you must be Elma Turner.

676
01:15:23,568 --> 01:15:24,984
I have something to tell her.
Something rather important.

677
01:15:25,443 --> 01:15:27,193
I'm very pleased to meet you.

678
01:15:27,484 --> 01:15:28,818
I need to see her.

679
01:15:29,026 --> 01:15:31,193
I don't believe that will be necessary.

680
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:34,026
Everything is happening
on a different level now...

681
01:15:34,443 --> 01:15:36,151
What do you mean by that?

682
01:15:38,401 --> 01:15:39,943
Where is she?

683
01:15:41,068 --> 01:15:43,484
At least, tell me she's okay...

684
01:15:48,818 --> 01:15:52,443
White skin, blue hair...
Interesting...

685
01:15:53,693 --> 01:15:58,526
Let me introduce myself...
lnspector Froebe.

686
01:16:02,234 --> 01:16:04,193
Did you powder up face
for the occassion?

687
01:16:04,276 --> 01:16:06,234
It's not your business.

688
01:16:17,401 --> 01:16:22,151
My friend, my dear, dear friend...

689
01:16:22,776 --> 01:16:26,443
Ayak meao venaseo filmea.
Kyle, It's been a long time ...

690
01:16:27,693 --> 01:16:35,609
Too long. I know.
I still feel the tension inside you.

691
01:16:35,734 --> 01:16:37,318
The hubris.

692
01:16:37,818 --> 01:16:44,901
Like five years ago when you sneaked
out without my permission...

693
01:16:45,151 --> 01:16:51,193
and took a bite out
of Inspector Froebe... Remember?

694
01:16:51,276 --> 01:16:54,234
lne lassa fine ninu, Ayak?
Do you need me for something Kyle?

695
01:16:54,609 --> 01:16:55,901
Yes.

696
01:17:01,151 --> 01:17:03,526
Have a taste of this!

697
01:17:03,693 --> 01:17:06,109
Find him and finish the rest!

698
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:36,818
Still alive?

699
01:17:38,901 --> 01:17:44,609
I know... this split personality
is not an easy thing to deal with

700
01:17:44,859 --> 01:17:48,859
But I'm the one on the front line...
until proven otherwise...

701
01:17:49,151 --> 01:17:50,651
Are you alone?

702
01:17:51,484 --> 01:17:53,026
So he's gone?

703
01:17:53,609 --> 01:17:55,568
The rapist who lives inside your body

704
01:17:55,818 --> 01:17:59,026
and forces me
to have sexual intercourse?

705
01:17:59,276 --> 01:18:05,443
I think so, but I'm not sure,
and above all I don't know ...

706
01:18:20,651 --> 01:18:24,234
That wasn't a very smart thing to do.

707
01:18:24,484 --> 01:18:29,151
The blue of my tears stains human
skin for good...

708
01:18:33,234 --> 01:18:37,068
I feel blue... for you.

709
01:18:52,234 --> 01:18:55,234
I should have shot
you the first time we met.

710
01:18:55,942 --> 01:18:57,817
There's still time.

711
01:19:48,109 --> 01:19:51,442
Thank you, Nikopol. Thank you...

712
01:19:55,234 --> 01:19:57,651
Shh! She's asleep.

713
01:19:58,234 --> 01:20:00,734
Young women like her are rare.

714
01:20:00,942 --> 01:20:03,192
Extremely rare.

715
01:20:03,734 --> 01:20:05,067
There are only a few
of them in the entire universe.

716
01:20:05,776 --> 01:20:09,192
No-one knows why they appear
in one world or another.

717
01:20:09,401 --> 01:20:13,192
They don't even know who they are,
themselves, and the power they have.

718
01:20:13,401 --> 01:20:14,942
What power?

719
01:20:15,151 --> 01:20:17,359
The greatest power of all.

720
01:20:17,567 --> 01:20:21,192
The power to procreate with gods.

721
01:20:21,401 --> 01:20:24,942
I get it. I'm just the empty shell...

722
01:20:25,151 --> 01:20:28,192
the vehicle delivering
the divine seeds...

723
01:20:28,442 --> 01:20:32,901
That's not going to alter
my opinion of you, ...

724
01:20:33,192 --> 01:20:37,109
I don't want to go.
Jonas can represent me.

725
01:20:37,359 --> 01:20:39,276
Don't Iet me down Kyle.

726
01:20:39,526 --> 01:20:42,151
Don't prove to me what
I already know you are...

727
01:20:42,359 --> 01:20:43,901
This is all your fault.

728
01:20:44,151 --> 01:20:46,234
You're the one who dragged me
into this.

729
01:20:46,401 --> 01:20:48,859
Have you just figured that out?

730
01:20:50,651 --> 01:20:54,359
Sure, Kyle! You're the pawn
and I'm the player!

731
01:20:54,651 --> 01:20:57,609
But I've got news for you,
you little bitch!

732
01:20:57,859 --> 01:21:01,567
You're a pawn too! EUGENlCS' pawn.
Who is EUGENlCS? Huh? Who?

733
01:21:03,401 --> 01:21:04,776
You're right on that one.

734
01:21:05,026 --> 01:21:11,026
But I'm a superior pawn.
Your superior pawn,you understand?

735
01:21:11,317 --> 01:21:13,567
Now, get up off your fat ass,
move into your TRlPLE XL clothes,

736
01:21:15,859 --> 01:21:17,067
say a little prayer that...

737
01:21:17,234 --> 01:21:19,692
... "your" DAYAK finds "your" NlKOPOL,

738
01:21:19,901 --> 01:21:23,692
and go and negotiate
with Ancient Egypt...

739
01:21:23,901 --> 01:21:25,526
MOVE IT!!

740
01:21:35,317 --> 01:21:38,026
Could you forget me if you had to?

741
01:21:39,067 --> 01:21:41,484
What sort of a question is that?

742
01:21:41,859 --> 01:21:44,651
Seriously.
If you didn't have the choice.

743
01:21:44,859 --> 01:21:45,526
Could you forget me?

744
01:21:45,776 --> 01:21:47,067
No.

745
01:21:48,734 --> 01:21:54,401
Well, I might forget you...
Against my will.

746
01:21:54,609 --> 01:21:57,109
Without wanting to.

747
01:22:00,109 --> 01:22:02,276
What are you trying to say?

748
01:22:06,151 --> 01:22:10,442
Things are going to happen to me
that are out of my control.

749
01:22:13,650 --> 01:22:15,900
I've already been through that.

750
01:22:16,484 --> 01:22:20,234
But I'm able to control
the future for two... Or more...

751
01:22:30,317 --> 01:22:32,817
You're pretty sure of yourself,
aren't you?

752
01:22:33,025 --> 01:22:34,525
How can you tell?

753
01:22:34,609 --> 01:22:40,150
Anyway, when you say two,
who are you alluding to?

754
01:22:40,484 --> 01:22:42,109
Are you thinking about you and me,

755
01:22:42,317 --> 01:22:44,859
or are you thinking about you and him.

756
01:22:45,067 --> 01:22:46,567
The one inside your body... the rapist.

757
01:22:47,817 --> 01:22:49,275
I'm thinking about us.

758
01:22:49,484 --> 01:22:51,150
Wouldn't he be jealous?

759
01:22:52,650 --> 01:22:53,775
Right now, for instance,

760
01:22:53,775 --> 01:23:00,025
I know he's here, between us...
I can sense him.

761
01:23:02,734 --> 01:23:06,567
The rapist wants you to know he
will never do that again.

762
01:23:10,734 --> 01:23:15,692
When I kiss you, am I kissing him too?

763
01:23:16,734 --> 01:23:19,234
And when he raped me,
did you enjoy it?

764
01:23:40,192 --> 01:23:41,400
John!

765
01:24:22,567 --> 01:24:25,275
Are you always so slow, lnspector?
What are you waiting for?

766
01:24:25,359 --> 01:24:26,817
An old friend of mine...

767
01:24:27,234 --> 01:24:31,025
The suspect vehicle just crossed 49th
and Madison on the second section.

768
01:24:31,192 --> 01:24:35,900
All patrols on alert.
I repeat: all patrols on alert.

769
01:24:45,275 --> 01:24:47,192
We're wasting precious time,
Inspector...

770
01:24:47,442 --> 01:24:49,192
Jill's in danger.

771
01:24:51,484 --> 01:24:52,442
Carefull...

772
01:24:52,525 --> 01:24:54,317
The engine's highly tuned.

773
01:24:55,567 --> 01:24:57,234
Just like you!

774
01:25:14,192 --> 01:25:15,317
I'm on their tail...

775
01:25:42,942 --> 01:25:44,317
Who's shooting?

776
01:25:47,317 --> 01:25:48,900
Hold your fire!

777
01:26:17,608 --> 01:26:19,483
Who's mortal in here?

778
01:26:19,567 --> 01:26:22,942
...I mean,
who can die a violent death...

779
01:26:23,317 --> 01:26:26,108
Well, I feel somewhat mortal...

780
01:26:26,317 --> 01:26:30,317
I don't think so, Mister...?

781
01:26:30,525 --> 01:26:33,233
Mr ...

782
01:27:00,233 --> 01:27:01,817
Jill!!

783
01:27:48,650 --> 01:27:50,108
Where's the Pyramid?

784
01:27:50,567 --> 01:27:52,233
Where's the Senator?

785
01:28:37,358 --> 01:28:38,650
It's here.

786
01:28:38,817 --> 01:28:39,858
Come on...

787
01:28:40,067 --> 01:28:43,817
It's here, Jill. It's time!

788
01:28:46,650 --> 01:28:49,442
We're in the heart of INTRUSION.

789
01:28:56,067 --> 01:28:57,900
The dead center.

790
01:28:58,692 --> 01:29:00,150
John!?

791
01:29:04,775 --> 01:29:06,483
Your time has come.

792
01:29:07,233 --> 01:29:10,733
This red pill is the final stage
of your treatment.

793
01:29:11,316 --> 01:29:13,983
It will make you human for good.

794
01:29:14,358 --> 01:29:15,816
A human woman...

795
01:29:15,983 --> 01:29:17,858
A human woman.

796
01:29:19,108 --> 01:29:23,941
Will I forget everything?... 
Everyone?

797
01:29:25,275 --> 01:29:30,941
You are going to write yourself
a new story...

798
01:29:32,733 --> 01:29:34,316
Swallow it!

799
01:29:38,691 --> 01:29:44,233
The void, Jill... The void...

800
01:29:44,233 --> 01:29:48,816
Forget me...Forget

801
01:29:52,441 --> 01:29:54,358
JOHN!?!

802
01:30:18,650 --> 01:30:26,358
...where the fuck are you?
I need you... I need you now!

803
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:34,275
You must be Anubis, God of the Dead...
I admire you so much!

804
01:30:34,525 --> 01:30:36,358
Eraid! You, fucking bastard.

805
01:30:36,566 --> 01:30:40,400
You'll never speak that
jackal's name again!

806
01:30:51,775 --> 01:30:54,275
Sep nuk pas, Heruss.
Time's up!

807
01:30:54,525 --> 01:30:56,983
Anuu mesen arit nef xupu!
This is the end of your Eternity!

808
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:03,066
Suten bat, akhet semut, suten bat!
Be patient brothers, I'm coming!

809
01:31:05,066 --> 01:31:10,941
Nikopol, you have been much more
than a body to me.

810
01:31:11,191 --> 01:31:14,691
I wish I could do more to thank you...

811
01:31:14,733 --> 01:31:17,233
...But you're running out of time,
I know...

812
01:31:17,650 --> 01:31:22,108
I sincerely hope your life
as a human is a happy one.

813
01:31:22,150 --> 01:31:25,400
You will no longer feel the burden
of your leg.

814
01:31:25,733 --> 01:31:32,566
You'll see, there will always
be a little bit of me left inside you...

815
01:31:33,691 --> 01:31:37,150
I don't know how I should take that.

816
01:31:41,441 --> 01:31:45,983
I will never be far from you, Jill,
ever again...

817
01:31:47,358 --> 01:31:48,941
Ever...

818
01:32:22,691 --> 01:32:24,233
Do I know you?

819
01:32:34,275 --> 01:32:39,691
Senu bat efu unnut xau?
I'm back! Were you bored without me?

820
01:32:40,066 --> 01:32:42,941
Kourou nevo pas
The sentence is binding

821
01:32:43,149 --> 01:32:48,483
Bes su xet, nes su xet tekau pa neter.
I'm ready to face it...Without waiting

822
01:32:48,649 --> 01:32:51,274
Set et fao
Now, then!

823
01:32:57,858 --> 01:32:59,816
Nikopol, serial number N-7,

824
01:33:00,066 --> 01:33:02,608
you are under arrest
for attempted escape.

825
01:33:02,816 --> 01:33:05,608
You have one year left
on your sentence.

826
01:33:06,733 --> 01:33:08,441
Sorry, but...

827
01:33:08,691 --> 01:33:10,608
He was in there, wasn't he?

828
01:33:10,899 --> 01:33:11,774
Who?

829
01:33:12,066 --> 01:33:15,941
The Killer...
You must know a lot about him.

830
01:33:16,024 --> 01:33:18,483
Yeah. He's a friend...

831
01:33:19,733 --> 01:33:24,524
How does he kill, I'd give a lot
to know the answer to that.

832
01:33:26,191 --> 01:33:27,608
Jill!

833
01:33:41,941 --> 01:33:42,774
...And New York City Officials annouces

834
01:33:43,233 --> 01:33:45,316
the opening of Central Parks Intrusion
to Public Access.

835
01:33:45,483 --> 01:33:48,024
Do not forget that the temperature
is unusually low.

836
01:33:48,233 --> 01:33:50,649
Take a break! New orbital holidays!

837
01:33:50,858 --> 01:33:52,441
Forget archaic politics,

838
01:33:52,524 --> 01:33:55,483
and say Yes to Liangs projects
for you and your City.

839
01:33:55,941 --> 01:33:57,274
And for you, who can still read,

840
01:33:57,316 --> 01:33:59,733
don't forget
"Spirit of Nikopol's Story",

841
01:34:00,149 --> 01:34:03,149
by the man from the past,
Nikopol himself. A Subversive Cult Book

842
01:34:03,399 --> 01:34:04,691
By the way, thanks for your book.
I could not put it down.

843
01:34:06,983 --> 01:34:09,649
What about her?

844
01:34:10,399 --> 01:34:11,649
"Her"?

845
01:34:13,733 --> 01:34:15,108
HER!

846
01:34:16,108 --> 01:34:17,983
Do you like Paris?

847
01:34:53,858 --> 01:34:58,524
Oh, I'm sorry. He's so cheeky,
did he hurt you?

848
01:34:58,733 --> 01:35:03,399
No, not at all. He's just fine...
Couldn't be better...

849
01:35:04,483 --> 01:35:06,649
I'm terribly sorry.

850
01:35:06,983 --> 01:35:09,149
My name is Jill.

851
01:35:09,358 --> 01:35:13,191
I'm NlKOPOL.

852
01:35:29,649 --> 01:35:31,524
How do you like this planet?

853
01:35:33,733 --> 01:35:35,524
It has its charm...

854
01:35:38,774 --> 01:35:41,983
Mais "Tout cela ne vaut
pas le poison qui decoule

855
01:35:42,191 --> 01:35:45,149
de tes yeux, de tes yeux verts,

856
01:35:45,399 --> 01:35:49,274
Lacs ou mon ame tremble et se
voit a l'envers...

857
01:35:49,524 --> 01:35:51,024
Mes songes viennent en foule

858
01:35:51,066 --> 01:35:55,066
Pour se desalterer
a ces gouffres amers."

859
01:35:55,733 --> 01:35:58,066
"But all that is not worth the prodigy

860
01:35:58,233 --> 01:36:00,733
Of you saliva, Jill,

861
01:36:00,941 --> 01:36:03,858
That bites my soul, and dizzies it,

862
01:36:04,108 --> 01:36:07,232
and swirls it down remorselessly,

863
01:36:07,441 --> 01:36:12,191
Rolling it, fainting,
to the underworld!"
