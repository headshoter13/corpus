1
00:02:01,764 --> 00:02:07,185
Stasis interrupted.
Fire in cryogenic compartment.

2
00:02:07,269 --> 00:02:11,773
Repeat.
Fire in cryogenic compartment.

3
00:02:11,857 --> 00:02:14,776
All personnel report to...

4
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,570
emergency escape vehicle.

5
00:02:17,655 --> 00:02:22,408
Launch of the escape lifeboat
will commence...

6
00:02:22,493 --> 00:02:26,412
in T-minus 20 seconds.

7
00:04:45,645 --> 00:04:47,562
Get goin', Frank. Get in there.

8
00:04:47,647 --> 00:04:50,482
Oh! Jesus Christ!

9
00:04:50,566 --> 00:04:52,984
Hell of a way to make a landing!

10
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:55,570
Use the torch.

11
00:05:06,832 --> 00:05:09,084
- How many?
- Don't know.

12
00:05:09,168 --> 00:05:10,835
Three. Maybe four.

13
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:15,257
Hey, Frank. Can we hurry this up?
It's gonna be 40 below in five minutes.

14
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:19,636
Come here! Come here!

15
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,347
- Oh, man, I'm gonna kill that thing!
- Hush up! Stop it!

16
00:05:22,431 --> 00:05:24,891
That stupid dog of yours.
Get it outta here!

17
00:05:25,017 --> 00:05:29,854
I hate that thing.
Get rid of the dog. Good.
Come on! Come on!

18
00:05:33,776 --> 00:05:36,278
A bad way to go, huh?

19
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,115
Hey, Frank, come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

20
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,117
Wait!

21
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:45,829
One of them's still alive.

22
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,968
Need any of this?
Right.

23
00:06:00,052 --> 00:06:01,970
We're gonna need
all of those.

24
00:06:12,732 --> 00:06:17,235
That's it. Okay.
You're all right.

25
00:07:34,105 --> 00:07:37,524
This is rumor control.
Here are the facts.

26
00:07:38,567 --> 00:07:41,111
As some of you know,

27
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:44,572
a 337 model E.E.V....

28
00:07:44,657 --> 00:07:47,826
crash-landed here at 0600...

29
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,537
on the morning watch.

30
00:07:50,621 --> 00:07:53,164
There was one survivor,

31
00:07:53,249 --> 00:07:57,627
two dead and a droid that was
hopelessly smashed beyond repair.

32
00:07:57,711 --> 00:08:00,296
The survivor is a woman.

33
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,967
That's what I saw.

34
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:06,594
I just want to say that I've taken
a vow of celibacy.

35
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,972
So have we all.
That also includes women.

36
00:08:09,098 --> 00:08:11,141
Yes.
We've all taken the vow!

37
00:08:11,267 --> 00:08:13,935
Shut your gob, Morse.
I'd like to say that I, for one,

38
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:16,521
do not appreciate company policy
allowing her to freely...

39
00:08:16,605 --> 00:08:18,731
intermingle with inmates
and the rest of the staff.

40
00:08:18,816 --> 00:08:23,486
What brother means to say is we view
the presence of any outsider,

41
00:08:23,571 --> 00:08:28,199
especially a woman,
as a violation of the harmony,

42
00:08:28,284 --> 00:08:30,201
a potential break
in the spiritual unity.

43
00:08:30,286 --> 00:08:32,871
We are well aware
of your feelings in this matter.

44
00:08:32,955 --> 00:08:37,625
You wilI be pleased to know
that I have requested a rescue team.

45
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:40,295
Hopefully, they will be here
inside of a week-

46
00:08:40,421 --> 00:08:44,466
Oh, come on!
and evacuate her A.S.A.P.

47
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,468
Don't give us that!

48
00:08:46,552 --> 00:08:48,428
What's her medical status?

49
00:08:48,512 --> 00:08:50,430
She doesn't seem
too badly damaged.

50
00:08:50,514 --> 00:08:54,350
She's unconscious. Can't give you
a more specific diagnosis at the moment.

51
00:08:54,435 --> 00:08:56,811
- Will she live?
- I would think so.

52
00:08:58,647 --> 00:09:00,565
Look. It's in
everybody's interest...

53
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:04,360
the woman doesn't come out of the infirmary
until the rescue team arrives.

54
00:09:04,487 --> 00:09:08,615
And certainly not without
an escort, right?
Sir.

55
00:09:09,909 --> 00:09:14,204
Gentlemen, we should all stick
to our set routine...

56
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:16,456
and not get unduly agitated.

57
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,041
Right.
Correct?

58
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:22,003
All right.
Thank you, gentlemen.

59
00:09:27,384 --> 00:09:29,302
All right.

60
00:09:29,428 --> 00:09:32,096
Better get here soon
or there ain't gonna be much left.

61
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,969
What's that?

62
00:10:12,221 --> 00:10:16,266
It's just a little cocktail of my own mix.
Sort of eye-opener.

63
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,768
You a doctor?

64
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:22,397
My name is Clemens.
I'm the chief medical officer here.

65
00:10:22,481 --> 00:10:25,525
Here?
Fury 161.

66
00:10:25,609 --> 00:10:28,987
It's one of Weyland-Yutani's
backwater work prisons,

67
00:10:29,071 --> 00:10:30,989
it grieves me to say.

68
00:10:31,073 --> 00:10:32,991
Do you mind?

69
00:10:35,536 --> 00:10:38,705
This is basically a stabilizer.

70
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:41,708
I really ought to shave your head.

71
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:44,294
We have a big problem with lice here.

72
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:46,879
And when you're feeling better,
I'll give you some clippers,

73
00:10:47,006 --> 00:10:51,009
and you can tend to
your private parts yourself.
How'd I get here?

74
00:10:52,553 --> 00:10:56,139
You crash-landed in an E.E.V.

75
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:59,684
Evidently separated from your mother ship
before you hit our atmosphere.

76
00:10:59,768 --> 00:11:03,146
You have any idea
how long you were in hypersleep?

77
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,857
'Cause coming out the way you did
can be quite a jolt to the system.

78
00:11:05,983 --> 00:11:08,443
Yeah, I'll be sick for a couple of weeks.
Indeed.

79
00:11:12,364 --> 00:11:15,283
- Where are the others?
- They didn't make it.

80
00:11:15,367 --> 00:11:18,453
- What?
- They didn't survive.

81
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,542
I have to get to the ship.

82
00:11:24,627 --> 00:11:27,712
- Have to get to the ship.
- You're in no condition for that.

83
00:11:27,796 --> 00:11:31,674
You want to get me some clothes,
or should I just go like this?

84
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:36,596
Given the nature of our indigenous population,
I would suggest clothes.

85
00:11:38,349 --> 00:11:41,559
- None of them
have seen a woman in years.

86
00:11:44,146 --> 00:11:46,481
Neither have I, for that matter.

87
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:52,236
This used to be
a 5,000 convict facility,

88
00:11:52,321 --> 00:11:55,823
but it's been reduced
to a custodial staff of 25.

89
00:11:55,908 --> 00:11:56,908
Why?

90
00:11:56,992 --> 00:11:58,993
Keep the pilot light on.
The pilot light for what?

91
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:04,666
Blast furnace. Natural methane.

92
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:08,378
We have a foundry,
Lieutenant Ripley.

93
00:12:08,462 --> 00:12:11,840
The inmates forge lead sheets
for toxic waste containers.

94
00:12:11,924 --> 00:12:14,676
How do you know my name?

95
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,554
It's stenciled
on the back of your shorts.

96
00:12:26,147 --> 00:12:29,107
Release the cable!

97
00:12:46,167 --> 00:12:48,710
Where are the bodies?
We have a morgue.

98
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:52,756
We put them there
until the investigative team arrives
in about a week, I think.

99
00:12:55,426 --> 00:12:59,095
There was a droid.
Disconnected.

100
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,681
There were bits and pieces of him
all over the place.

101
00:13:01,766 --> 00:13:03,850
We put what was left
on the rubbish tip.

102
00:13:03,934 --> 00:13:07,312
The corporal was impaled
by that safety support.

103
00:13:07,396 --> 00:13:09,356
He never knew what hit him.

104
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,816
And the girl?

105
00:13:11,901 --> 00:13:15,236
She drowned in her cryo-tube.

106
00:13:15,321 --> 00:13:19,741
I don't think she was conscious
when it happened.

107
00:13:19,825 --> 00:13:22,994
Um, I'm sorry.

108
00:13:42,731 --> 00:13:44,648
What's the matter?

109
00:13:44,774 --> 00:13:48,193
Where is she?
In the morgue.

110
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:50,195
I have to see her.

111
00:13:51,614 --> 00:13:53,532
I have to see what's left of her.

112
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:04,752
Oh, God, there you are.
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

113
00:14:04,836 --> 00:14:07,546
Where you been, huh?

114
00:14:10,258 --> 00:14:12,968
Oh, my-

115
00:14:16,306 --> 00:14:18,349
Come here.

116
00:14:20,185 --> 00:14:23,520
You okay?
Let me see, Spike.
Let me see. Are you okay?

117
00:14:23,646 --> 00:14:26,815
Let me see.

118
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,986
What have you been sticking
your face into, huh? Here.

119
00:14:32,364 --> 00:14:34,698
Did somebody
do this to you?

120
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:42,956
What kind of animal
would do this to a dog?

121
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,568
Um-

122
00:15:11,653 --> 00:15:14,071
C-Could I have a moment
alone, please?

123
00:15:14,155 --> 00:15:16,115
Yes, of course.

124
00:15:49,316 --> 00:15:51,317
Forgive me.

125
00:16:15,383 --> 00:16:18,135
What's she doing?

126
00:16:30,148 --> 00:16:32,650
Okay?

127
00:16:32,734 --> 00:16:34,944
No.

128
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:37,905
We have to do an autopsy.

129
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:39,740
What?
I told you,

130
00:16:39,824 --> 00:16:42,076
we have to make sure
how she died.

131
00:16:43,495 --> 00:16:46,789
And I told you, she drowned.

132
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:52,419
I'm not so sure.
I-I have to see inside of her.

133
00:16:52,504 --> 00:16:54,922
You're disorientated.
Half your system's still in-

134
00:16:55,006 --> 00:16:57,007
I have a very,
very good reason.

135
00:16:57,092 --> 00:16:59,176
Well, perhaps you'd like to
share that reason.

136
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:05,307
Possible contagion.

137
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:08,269
What kind exactly?

138
00:17:08,353 --> 00:17:10,354
- Cholera.
- Cholera?

139
00:17:14,192 --> 00:17:16,986
There hasn't been a case of cholera
reported for 200 years.

140
00:17:23,577 --> 00:17:25,578
Please.

141
00:18:02,073 --> 00:18:05,075
Everything's in place.

142
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,537
There's no sign of infection.

143
00:18:08,622 --> 00:18:11,332
No indication of disease.
Chest.

144
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,375
Open the chest.

145
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,886
Careful.

146
00:18:55,293 --> 00:18:57,586
Lungs.

147
00:18:59,714 --> 00:19:01,965
Flooded with fluid.

148
00:19:03,802 --> 00:19:06,095
Ergo, she drowned.

149
00:19:11,893 --> 00:19:17,064
Now, since I'm not
a complete idiot,

150
00:19:17,148 --> 00:19:20,984
would you like to tell me
what we're really looking for?

151
00:19:29,911 --> 00:19:32,246
Mr. Clemens.

152
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,248
Superintendent.

153
00:19:35,917 --> 00:19:39,336
I don't believe you've met
Lieutenant Ripley.

154
00:19:39,421 --> 00:19:41,422
What's going on, Mr. Clemens?

155
00:19:41,506 --> 00:19:43,632
That's right, sir.
What's going on, Mr. Clemens?

156
00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:47,010
Well, first-

157
00:19:47,095 --> 00:19:51,932
the lieutenant is feeling much better,
I'm happy to say.

158
00:19:52,016 --> 00:19:54,476
Second, in the interest
of public health,

159
00:19:54,602 --> 00:19:57,271
I am performing an autopsy.
Without my authority.

160
00:19:57,355 --> 00:19:59,773
Well, there didn't
seem to be time.

161
00:19:59,858 --> 00:20:01,734
But it's turned out all right.

162
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,278
There's no sign of contagion in the body.
Good.

163
00:20:04,362 --> 00:20:08,115
But it might be helpful if Lt. Ripley
didn't parade around in front of the prisoners,

164
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:10,325
as I am told she did in the last hour.

165
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,327
It might also be helpful...

166
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:15,456
if you kept me informed as to
any change in her physical status.

167
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,916
Or would that be asking too much?

168
00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:23,422
- We have to cremate the bodies.
- Nonsense. We'll keep the bodies on ice
till the rescue team arrives.

169
00:20:23,506 --> 00:20:27,885
- On ice.
- There is the public health issue.

170
00:20:27,969 --> 00:20:32,973
The lieutenant feels that there is still
a possibility of a communicable infection.

171
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:37,311
I thought you said
there was no sign of disease.

172
00:20:37,395 --> 00:20:39,521
It would appear that the child drowned.

173
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:42,149
But without the benefit
of proper laboratory tests,

174
00:20:42,233 --> 00:20:44,151
it's impossible
to be absolutely certain.

175
00:20:44,235 --> 00:20:46,487
I would consider it unwise...

176
00:20:46,571 --> 00:20:50,324
to tolerate even the possibility
of an unwelcome virus.

177
00:20:50,408 --> 00:20:54,870
An outbreak of cholera
would look extremely bad on a report.

178
00:20:54,996 --> 00:20:57,289
Would it not, sir?

179
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,376
We've 25 prisoners in this facility.

180
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:03,545
All double-y-chromos.

181
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:07,841
All thieves, rapists,
murderers, child molesters. All scum.

182
00:21:07,926 --> 00:21:12,679
Just because they've taken on religion
doesn't make them any less dangerous.

183
00:21:12,764 --> 00:21:15,182
I try not to offend their convictions.

184
00:21:15,266 --> 00:21:17,768
I don't want to upset the order.

185
00:21:18,937 --> 00:21:21,355
I don't want ripples in the water.

186
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:26,443
And I don't want a woman walking around
giving them ideas.

187
00:21:26,528 --> 00:21:30,572
I see. For my own personal safety.

188
00:21:31,741 --> 00:21:33,700
Exactly.

189
00:21:33,785 --> 00:21:38,413
I will leave the details of the cremation
to you, Mr. Clemens.

190
00:21:40,792 --> 00:21:44,837
They may use the furnace, but I want
everyone back in lockup by 2200 hours.

191
00:21:44,921 --> 00:21:46,964
You called it, sir.

192
00:22:49,828 --> 00:22:52,746
"We commit this child...

193
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:56,291
"and this man
to your keeping, O Lord.

194
00:22:57,335 --> 00:22:59,586
"Their bodies...

195
00:22:59,671 --> 00:23:04,675
"have been taken
from the shadow of our nights.

196
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:10,180
"They have been released...

197
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:14,518
from all darkness and pain."

198
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:22,192
"The child and the man...

199
00:23:22,277 --> 00:23:26,864
"have gone beyond our world.

200
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:30,743
"They are forever eternal...

201
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:33,078
"and everlasting.

202
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:42,838
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust."

203
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:47,634
Why?

204
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:50,387
Why are the innocent punished?

205
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:58,228
Why the sacrifice?

206
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:02,858
Why the pain?

207
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:08,697
There aren't any promises.

208
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:12,743
- Nothing's certain.

209
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:17,956
Only that some get called,
some get saved.

210
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:22,836
She won't ever know
the hardship and grief...

211
00:24:22,921 --> 00:24:25,547
- for those of us left behind.

212
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:29,802
We commit these bodies
to the void...

213
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:32,304
with a glad heart.

214
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:44,775
For within each seed,

215
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:47,277
there is a promise of a flower.

216
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:53,325
And within each death,

217
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:57,663
no matter how small,

218
00:24:57,747 --> 00:24:59,915
there's always a new life.

219
00:25:03,962 --> 00:25:06,797
A new beginning.

220
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:15,139
- Amen.

221
00:25:15,223 --> 00:25:16,640
Amen.

222
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:50,591
I'll tell you, it's fucking weird.

223
00:25:50,675 --> 00:25:53,343
The only one to survive
that crash is a woman.

224
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:55,554
What trouble can she cause?

225
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:57,556
She's already changed everything.

226
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:09,401
What the fuck are we supposed to do-

227
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:12,487
I, for one-

228
00:26:13,865 --> 00:26:16,116
I mean it!

229
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:25,667
Messin' round here,
that's for sure.

230
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:31,048
Well, hello.

231
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:21,723
I just wanted to, uh, say thanks
for what you said at the funeral.
It was, uh-

232
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:25,477
My friends would have
appreciated it.

233
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:28,355
Yeah, well, you don't
wanna know me, lady.

234
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:32,526
I'm a murderer
and rapist of women.

235
00:27:33,945 --> 00:27:36,613
Really?

236
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:42,202
Well, I guess
I must make you nervous.

237
00:27:57,593 --> 00:28:01,305
- Do you have any faith, sister?
- Not much.

238
00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:06,226
WelI, we've got a lot of faith here.
Enough even for you.

239
00:28:06,311 --> 00:28:08,979
I thought women weren't allowed.

240
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:10,981
Well, we've never had any before,

241
00:28:11,065 --> 00:28:15,277
but we tolerate anybody.

242
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:20,032
- Even the intolerable.
- Thank you.

243
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:24,745
That's just a statement of principle.
Nothing personal.

244
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:28,206
You see, we've got
a good place to wait here.

245
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:31,918
And until now, no temptation.

246
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:38,925
Dillon and the rest
of the alternative people...

247
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:43,555
embraced religion, as it were,
about five years ago.

248
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:46,767
Tincture?
I'm on medication.

249
00:28:46,893 --> 00:28:49,353
Hardly.
What kind of religion?

250
00:28:49,437 --> 00:28:54,858
Some sort of apocalyptic, millenarian,
Christian fundamentalist, uh-

251
00:28:54,984 --> 00:28:57,319
Right.
Exactly.

252
00:28:57,403 --> 00:29:00,238
Point is, when the company
wanted to close the facility down,

253
00:29:00,323 --> 00:29:03,992
Dillon and the rest of the converts
wanted to stay.

254
00:29:04,077 --> 00:29:08,205
And they were allowed
to remain as custodians...

255
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:11,208
with two minders...

256
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:13,960
and a medical officer.

257
00:29:14,045 --> 00:29:16,129
And here we are.

258
00:29:16,214 --> 00:29:18,507
How did you get
this wonderful assignment?

259
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:23,720
How do you like
your new haircut?

260
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,557
It's okay.

261
00:29:44,659 --> 00:29:48,370
Now that I've gone out on a limb
for you with Andrews,

262
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:51,706
damaged my already less-than-perfect
relationship with that good man,

263
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:54,209
and briefed you...

264
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:58,171
on the humdrum history
of Fury 161,

265
00:29:58,256 --> 00:30:00,590
can you not tell me
what you were looking for in the girl?

266
00:30:00,675 --> 00:30:03,718
You attracted to me?

267
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:05,929
In what way?

268
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:10,058
In that way.

269
00:30:11,853 --> 00:30:14,438
Very direct.

270
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,774
I've been out here a long time.

271
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:27,711
In the year 7510

272
00:30:27,795 --> 00:30:29,963
If God's a-comin'

273
00:30:30,048 --> 00:30:33,717
He oughta make it by then

274
00:30:33,801 --> 00:30:37,387
Maybe he'll look around and say

275
00:30:37,472 --> 00:30:40,766
Guess it's time for the Judgment-

276
00:31:04,665 --> 00:31:06,374
Yech!

277
00:31:08,669 --> 00:31:10,670
In the year

278
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:20,680
Hey, Spike.
Spike? Spikey!

279
00:31:25,937 --> 00:31:29,064
Are you down there?
What are you doing?

280
00:32:13,572 --> 00:32:16,157
I really appreciate your affections,

281
00:32:18,077 --> 00:32:21,079
but I am aware that they...
deflected my question.

282
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,000
In the nicest possible way, of course.

283
00:32:29,755 --> 00:32:31,923
You're spoiling the mood.

284
00:32:32,925 --> 00:32:35,844
I have a job to do.

285
00:32:35,928 --> 00:32:38,304
I just want to know why
we had to cremate the bodies.

286
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:41,433
I had a terrible dream in hypersleep.

287
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:45,478
And I had to be sure what killed her.

288
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:47,814
Anyway, I made a mistake.

289
00:32:47,898 --> 00:32:50,692
Possibly.

290
00:32:50,776 --> 00:32:54,821
And now I've made
another mistake.

291
00:32:54,905 --> 00:32:56,823
Really? What's that?

292
00:32:56,907 --> 00:32:59,534
Fraternizing with a prisoner.

293
00:32:59,618 --> 00:33:03,788
Physical contact.
It's against the rules, isn't it?

294
00:33:06,917 --> 00:33:09,586
I'm not a prisoner.

295
00:33:11,505 --> 00:33:14,674
You have a bar code
on the back of your head.

296
00:33:18,971 --> 00:33:21,639
That does deserve an explanation.

297
00:33:23,517 --> 00:33:26,644
But I don't think
now is the moment.

298
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,734
Mr. Clemens.

299
00:33:34,162 --> 00:33:37,956
Mr. Aaron.
Superintendent Andrews
would like you to report...

300
00:33:38,041 --> 00:33:41,752
to vent shaft 22
on the second quadrant- now.

301
00:33:41,878 --> 00:33:43,921
We've had an accident.
Something serious?

302
00:33:44,005 --> 00:33:49,343
You could call it that.
One of our prisoners has been... diced.

303
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:53,180
Sorry. I have to go.

304
00:33:55,558 --> 00:33:57,559
Official duties.

305
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:29,425
- Who was it?
- Murphy.

306
00:34:29,509 --> 00:34:31,510
How do you know?

307
00:34:31,594 --> 00:34:34,096
That's his boot.

308
00:34:35,765 --> 00:34:38,559
I gave him the assignment, sir.
He was a wanker.

309
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:41,061
No apologies, Mr. Aaron.
It wasn't your fault.

310
00:34:52,907 --> 00:34:55,033
Well, not much to say, is there?

311
00:34:55,118 --> 00:34:58,162
Death was instantaneous.
No shit.

312
00:34:58,246 --> 00:35:00,622
I take it he was pulled
into the fan.

313
00:35:00,707 --> 00:35:02,666
Sudden rush of air,
I'd imagine, except-

314
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,835
Right.
Almost happened to me once.

315
00:35:04,919 --> 00:35:09,298
I've told him so many times,
"Stay away from the fans."

316
00:35:09,382 --> 00:35:11,300
Nobody bloody listens.

317
00:35:11,384 --> 00:35:14,511
Except the fan was blowing.

318
00:35:21,478 --> 00:35:23,562
- What's that?
- I don't know.

319
00:35:23,646 --> 00:35:28,442
I want to see you in my quarters
in 30 minutes, if you'll please, Mr. Clemens.

320
00:35:33,948 --> 00:35:36,825
Have you got any ideas?

321
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:25,503
Here you are. You know,
wandering around without an escort...

322
00:36:25,587 --> 00:36:29,423
is really gonna piss
Superintendent Andrews off.

323
00:36:29,508 --> 00:36:31,842
Will you tell me
about your accident?

324
00:36:31,927 --> 00:36:35,554
One of the prisoners has been killed.

325
00:36:35,681 --> 00:36:38,015
Really? How?
Hmm.

326
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,601
In the air shaft.

327
00:36:40,686 --> 00:36:43,187
Poor soul backed into a nine-foot fan.

328
00:36:44,356 --> 00:36:46,732
I found something
at the accident site,

329
00:36:46,817 --> 00:36:50,236
just a bit away
from where it happened.

330
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,864
A mark. A burn.

331
00:36:55,367 --> 00:36:58,285
Rather like the one you found
on the girl's cryo-tube.

332
00:37:04,668 --> 00:37:08,587
Look. I'm on your side.

333
00:37:08,672 --> 00:37:12,133
I want to help, but I need to know
what's going on...

334
00:37:12,217 --> 00:37:14,593
or what you think is going on.

335
00:37:17,222 --> 00:37:19,265
If you really wanna help,

336
00:37:19,349 --> 00:37:21,475
find me a computer
with audio capabilities...

337
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,728
so I can access this flight recorder.

338
00:37:23,812 --> 00:37:25,938
We don't have anything
like that here.

339
00:37:26,064 --> 00:37:28,190
Well, what about Bishop?
Bishop?

340
00:37:28,275 --> 00:37:30,818
The droid that crashed with me.

341
00:37:30,902 --> 00:37:33,279
I can point you in the right direction.

342
00:37:33,363 --> 00:37:35,322
I can't join you.

343
00:37:35,407 --> 00:37:38,617
I have a previous engagement.

344
00:37:40,203 --> 00:37:42,455
Listen to me, you piece of shit.

345
00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:45,458
You screw with me
one more time, I'll cut you in half.

346
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,753
I'm sorry.
I don't think I understand.

347
00:37:48,837 --> 00:37:51,839
At 0700 hours, I received word
from the network.

348
00:37:51,923 --> 00:37:54,800
I may point out this is the first
high-level communication...

349
00:37:54,885 --> 00:37:59,013
this installation has ever received,
to my knowledge.

350
00:37:59,097 --> 00:38:00,973
They want this woman looked after.

351
00:38:01,099 --> 00:38:03,809
They consider her to be
very high priority.
Why?

352
00:38:03,894 --> 00:38:06,187
I have no idea.

353
00:38:06,271 --> 00:38:09,565
But why did you let her
out of the infirmary?

354
00:38:09,649 --> 00:38:11,817
This accident with Murphy
is what happens...

355
00:38:11,902 --> 00:38:14,904
when one of these dumb sons of a bitches
walks around with a hard-on.

356
00:38:14,988 --> 00:38:17,698
I'm a doctor. You're the jailer.

357
00:38:19,451 --> 00:38:23,078
We both know exactly what you are.

358
00:38:23,205 --> 00:38:26,332
Sit down.
I think it might be better if I left.

359
00:38:26,416 --> 00:38:30,127
I find you...
unpleasant to be around.

360
00:38:30,212 --> 00:38:33,547
You do? Isn't that lovely?
Consider this, Mr. Clemens.

361
00:38:33,632 --> 00:38:36,759
How would you like me to explain
your sordid history...

362
00:38:36,843 --> 00:38:39,094
to your newfound friend?

363
00:38:39,179 --> 00:38:42,973
For her personal
edification, of course.

364
00:38:43,058 --> 00:38:45,643
Now sit the hell down.

365
00:38:56,822 --> 00:39:00,241
Now, is there anything I should know?

366
00:40:38,131 --> 00:40:40,507
- Shut up, you fuckin' bitch!

367
00:40:40,592 --> 00:40:42,968
- Get in there!
- Shut up, you bitch!

368
00:40:43,053 --> 00:40:47,222
- Nobody's gonna hear you.
- Goddamn it, let go of me!

369
00:40:47,307 --> 00:40:49,892
Fuck you! No!

370
00:40:50,018 --> 00:40:53,020
Hold still! Shh! Shh!

371
00:40:53,104 --> 00:40:54,855
No! Goddamn it!

372
00:41:02,739 --> 00:41:04,782
You okay?

373
00:41:05,951 --> 00:41:09,078
No! Son of a bitch!

374
00:41:14,626 --> 00:41:18,837
Take off. I gotta reeducate
some of the brothers.

375
00:41:18,922 --> 00:41:21,757
We've gotta discuss
some matters of the spirit.

376
00:41:33,362 --> 00:41:36,406
This is like 10 city blocks.

377
00:41:38,993 --> 00:41:44,914
How many?
This makes 176.

378
00:41:44,999 --> 00:41:47,584
Can't you chew a little quieter?

379
00:41:47,668 --> 00:41:49,836
I'm trying to figure out
how big this compartment is.

380
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,714
I can't think with all this
goddamn noise you're making.

381
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,675
You're not supposed to swear.
I'm sorry.

382
00:41:55,759 --> 00:42:00,179
- Now, we've encircled
this entire compartment once-
- Hey.

383
00:42:00,264 --> 00:42:02,724
What?

384
00:42:06,687 --> 00:42:08,646
What the shit is doing that?

385
00:42:08,731 --> 00:42:10,481
Swearing.
Shut up.

386
00:42:10,566 --> 00:42:13,067
It's alI right to say "shit."
It ain't against God.

387
00:42:13,152 --> 00:42:15,528
What the hell is going on
with the candles?

388
00:42:19,992 --> 00:42:22,827
Must be the wind
from one of the vent shafts.

389
00:42:22,911 --> 00:42:25,705
Backwash from the closest
circulating unit.

390
00:42:25,789 --> 00:42:28,791
But if all the candles go out,
how the hell we gonna know
where we are?

391
00:42:28,876 --> 00:42:32,170
Somebody will just have to
go back and relight them.

392
00:42:32,254 --> 00:42:35,048
I guess I'm nominated.

393
00:42:44,725 --> 00:42:47,393
Watch your step, brother.

394
00:42:56,487 --> 00:43:00,281
Okay, who are the comedians?

395
00:43:46,328 --> 00:43:48,246
Wait, wait, wait!

396
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:50,498
- Quick, grab it. Here.
- Help me! Help me!

397
00:43:52,292 --> 00:43:55,336
Go! Fuckin' go!

398
00:43:57,256 --> 00:44:00,717
Go, go, go! Quick! Run!

399
00:44:09,935 --> 00:44:11,936
Gimme that!

400
00:44:51,852 --> 00:44:54,270
Get this fucking thing off me!

401
00:44:54,354 --> 00:44:56,564
Oh, fuck!

402
00:45:56,708 --> 00:45:58,709
Hey.

403
00:46:00,087 --> 00:46:02,296
Ah, Ripley.

404
00:46:02,381 --> 00:46:06,008
Hi, Bishop.
How you feeling?

405
00:46:06,093 --> 00:46:08,052
My legs hurt.

406
00:46:08,136 --> 00:46:10,346
Uh, listen, I'm sorry.

407
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:13,015
It's okay.
I'm just a glorified toaster.

408
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:15,101
How are you?

409
00:46:16,436 --> 00:46:18,729
I like your new haircut.

410
00:46:18,814 --> 00:46:21,065
Bishop, can you access data
on the flight recorder?

411
00:46:21,149 --> 00:46:21,816
No problem.

412
00:46:27,786 --> 00:46:31,038
I'm home.
What happened on the Sulaco?

413
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:33,749
Why were our cryo-tubes ejected?

414
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:36,376
Stasis interrupted.

415
00:46:36,461 --> 00:46:40,339
Fire in cryogenic compartment.

416
00:46:40,465 --> 00:46:43,926
Repeat. Fire in cryogenic-
What happened?

417
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:46,553
What started the fire, Bishop?

418
00:46:46,638 --> 00:46:48,639
Can you hear me?

419
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:51,934
The fire was electrical.

420
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:55,270
It was in the subflooring.

421
00:46:55,355 --> 00:46:58,941
Did the sensors pick up anything
moving around on the ship prior to separation?

422
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:02,486
It's very dark here, Ripley.
I'm not what I used to be.

423
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:06,949
Just tell me. Does the recorder
indicate anything?

424
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:09,493
Was there an alien on board?

425
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:12,788
Yes.

426
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:20,254
Is it on the Sulaco or did it
come with us on the E.E.V.?

427
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:23,674
It was with us all the way.

428
00:47:26,636 --> 00:47:29,680
Does the company know?

429
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:32,933
The company knows everything
that happened on the ship.

430
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:37,437
It all goes into the computer
and gets sent back to network.

431
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:39,481
And they want it.

432
00:47:39,566 --> 00:47:44,862
I hurt. Do me a favor.
Disconnect me.

433
00:47:44,946 --> 00:47:49,032
I could be reworked,
but I'll never be top of the line again.

434
00:47:49,117 --> 00:47:51,785
I'd rather be nothing.

435
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:54,371
You're sure?

436
00:47:56,124 --> 00:47:58,709
Do it for me, Ripley.

437
00:48:12,851 --> 00:48:16,771
It wasn't me! I didn't do it!

438
00:48:16,855 --> 00:48:20,983
It was- It was the dragon.

439
00:48:21,067 --> 00:48:23,235
Feeds on minds. It was-

440
00:48:23,361 --> 00:48:25,696
Nobody can stop it.
What about Boggs and Rains?

441
00:48:25,781 --> 00:48:28,115
They got s-slaughtered like pigs.
It wasn't me!

442
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:32,953
- It wasn't me!
- Stark raving mad.

443
00:48:33,038 --> 00:48:35,706
I'm not saying it was anyone's fault,
but he should have been chained up.

444
00:48:35,791 --> 00:48:39,126
You called it, sir.
Mad as a fucking hatter.

445
00:48:39,211 --> 00:48:43,005
Keep him separated from the rest.
I don't want him causing a panic.

446
00:48:43,089 --> 00:48:45,257
Clemens,
sedate this poor idiot.
Yeah?

447
00:48:45,342 --> 00:48:47,760
Not until we know about the brothers.

448
00:48:47,844 --> 00:48:51,680
Now, now. Pull yourself together.
Talk to me now.

449
00:48:51,807 --> 00:48:54,683
Now, where are Boggs and Rains?
It wasn't me!

450
00:48:54,768 --> 00:48:56,644
Hopeless. You're not gonna
get anything out of him.

451
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:59,605
It wasn't me.
We'll have to send out
a search team.

452
00:48:59,689 --> 00:49:02,024
I'm afraid we'll have to assume
there's a very good chance...

453
00:49:02,108 --> 00:49:04,443
this simple bastard
has murdered them.

454
00:49:06,321 --> 00:49:08,697
Now, you don't know that.

455
00:49:09,699 --> 00:49:12,451
He's never lied to me.

456
00:49:12,536 --> 00:49:15,788
He's crazy, he's a fool,
but he's not a liar.

457
00:49:17,833 --> 00:49:20,167
He's telling the truth.

458
00:49:20,252 --> 00:49:23,379
I'd like to talk to him
about this- this dragon.

459
00:49:23,463 --> 00:49:26,423
- It was a dragon.
- You're not talking
to anyone, Lieutenant.

460
00:49:26,508 --> 00:49:29,385
I'm not interested in your opinion,

461
00:49:29,469 --> 00:49:31,595
because you are not
in full possession of the facts.

462
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,224
This man is a convicted multiple murderer,
known for particularly brutal crimes.

463
00:49:35,308 --> 00:49:37,977
Isn't that right, Mr. Dillon?

464
00:49:38,061 --> 00:49:40,855
Yeah. That part's right.

465
00:49:43,275 --> 00:49:45,776
Then I'll talk to you. It's important.

466
00:49:45,861 --> 00:49:48,279
When I have finished
with my official duties,

467
00:49:48,363 --> 00:49:51,490
I will be quite pleased
to have a little chat, yes?

468
00:49:55,871 --> 00:50:01,250
Let me see if I have
this correct, Lieutenant.
It's an eight-foot creature of some kind,

469
00:50:01,334 --> 00:50:05,588
with acid for blood,
and it arrived on your spaceship.

470
00:50:05,672 --> 00:50:09,174
It kills on sight
and is generally unpleasant.

471
00:50:09,259 --> 00:50:11,802
And, of course, you expect me to accept
all this on your word.

472
00:50:11,887 --> 00:50:14,263
No, I don't expect anything.

473
00:50:14,347 --> 00:50:19,184
- Quite a story, Mr. Aaron.
- Right, sir. It's a beauty.

474
00:50:19,269 --> 00:50:22,229
- Never heard anything quite like it, sir.
- Expect not.

475
00:50:22,314 --> 00:50:24,398
Tell me, Lieutenant,
what would you suggest we do?

476
00:50:26,776 --> 00:50:29,194
Well, what kind
of weapons have you got?

477
00:50:29,279 --> 00:50:31,280
This is a prison.

478
00:50:31,364 --> 00:50:33,824
It's not a good idea to allow prisoners
access to firearms.

479
00:50:33,909 --> 00:50:35,701
What keeps them from killing you?

480
00:50:35,785 --> 00:50:38,746
Fear. There's no way to escape.

481
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:42,791
With the arrival of the next supply ship,
the company would eliminate them.

482
00:50:42,876 --> 00:50:46,754
This is a maximum security prison,

483
00:50:48,256 --> 00:50:51,967
and you have no weapons of any kind?

484
00:50:54,262 --> 00:50:58,057
We have some carving knives in the abattoir.
A few more in the mess hall.

485
00:50:58,141 --> 00:51:01,560
Some fire axes scattered about the place.
Nothing terribly formidable.

486
00:51:01,645 --> 00:51:02,937
That's all?

487
00:51:03,021 --> 00:51:04,772
We're on the honor system.

488
00:51:10,824 --> 00:51:14,993
- Then we're fucked.
- No, you're fucked.

489
00:51:15,078 --> 00:51:18,497
Confined to the infirmary.
Quarantined.

490
00:51:18,581 --> 00:51:21,291
Mr. Aaron will escort you.

491
00:51:21,376 --> 00:51:25,671
I think you'll be safe from any large,
nasty beast while you're there, right?

492
00:51:27,674 --> 00:51:30,843
Yes, that's a good girl.

493
00:51:30,969 --> 00:51:33,720
Let's all report to the mess hall.

494
00:51:33,805 --> 00:51:38,642
Superintendent Andrews wants a meeting.
Mess hall, right away, people.

495
00:51:38,726 --> 00:51:42,020
Isn't there any way off of this place?
Some way to escape?

496
00:51:42,105 --> 00:51:45,858
No. Supply ship comes every six months.

497
00:51:46,401 --> 00:51:48,694
- And that's it?
- And that's it.

498
00:51:48,778 --> 00:51:50,487
Fuck.

499
00:51:51,698 --> 00:51:55,909
They are sending somebody
to pick you up quite soon, I gather.

500
00:51:55,994 --> 00:51:58,829
Really.
What's "soon"?

501
00:51:58,913 --> 00:52:03,584
I don't know. Nobody's ever been
in a hurry to get here before.

502
00:52:06,254 --> 00:52:09,173
Do you want to tell me
what you and Andrews talked about?

503
00:52:09,257 --> 00:52:11,508
No.

504
00:52:11,634 --> 00:52:15,637
You'll just say I'm crazy.

505
00:52:15,722 --> 00:52:21,643
- That's a bit uncharitable.

506
00:52:24,814 --> 00:52:26,815
How are you feeling?

507
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:31,028
Not so hot.

508
00:52:31,112 --> 00:52:33,030
Sore throat.

509
00:52:33,114 --> 00:52:37,034
Sick to my stomach.
Pissed off.

510
00:52:37,118 --> 00:52:40,954
Well, that's understandable
given the circumstances.

511
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:44,541
Perhaps I should give you
one of my special cocktails.

512
00:52:44,667 --> 00:52:47,461
I don't know why everybody
blames everybody for everything.

513
00:52:47,545 --> 00:52:50,130
Nobody's perfect, only human.

514
00:52:50,215 --> 00:52:53,300
I don't know a perfect human.
Nobody I know.

515
00:52:54,677 --> 00:52:57,554
You married?

516
00:52:57,639 --> 00:53:00,224
Me?
You should get married,
have kids.

517
00:53:00,308 --> 00:53:05,437
Pretty girl. I used to know
lots of 'em back home.

518
00:53:05,522 --> 00:53:08,482
They used to like me.

519
00:53:10,902 --> 00:53:12,819
For a while.

520
00:53:17,909 --> 00:53:19,868
You're gonna die too.

521
00:53:27,919 --> 00:53:31,630
Are you?
What?

522
00:53:31,714 --> 00:53:33,966
Married.

523
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:36,468
Why?

524
00:53:36,553 --> 00:53:39,805
- Just curious.
- No.

525
00:53:42,725 --> 00:53:46,186
How about leveling with me?

526
00:53:46,271 --> 00:53:49,940
When I asked how you got assigned here,
you avoided the question.

527
00:53:50,024 --> 00:53:53,193
And then when I asked about the prison I.D.
tattooed on the back of your head,

528
00:53:53,278 --> 00:53:55,153
you ducked me again.

529
00:53:58,116 --> 00:54:00,367
It's a long, sad story...

530
00:54:01,578 --> 00:54:03,870
and more than
a little melodramatic.

531
00:54:03,955 --> 00:54:06,373
Try me.

532
00:54:08,376 --> 00:54:10,877
If you insist.

533
00:54:15,592 --> 00:54:17,926
After my student years,

534
00:54:19,012 --> 00:54:22,014
despite the fact that I had become...

535
00:54:22,098 --> 00:54:24,516
secretly addicted to morphine,

536
00:54:24,601 --> 00:54:26,852
I was considered
to be most promising,

537
00:54:26,936 --> 00:54:29,354
a man with a future.

538
00:54:32,358 --> 00:54:36,653
And during my first residency,
I did a 36-hour stretch on an E.R.

539
00:54:37,947 --> 00:54:41,491
So, I went out and I got
more than a little drunk.

540
00:54:41,576 --> 00:54:43,702
Then I got called back.

541
00:54:43,786 --> 00:54:45,954
Boiler had blown on a fuel plant,

542
00:54:46,039 --> 00:54:49,166
and there were 30 casualties.

543
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:51,543
And 11 of them died.

544
00:54:51,628 --> 00:54:53,795
Not as a result of the accident...

545
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,340
but because I prescribed
the wrong dosage of painkiller.

546
00:54:58,468 --> 00:55:02,471
I got seven years in prison
and my license reduced to a 3-C.

547
00:55:05,475 --> 00:55:07,768
At least I got off the morphine.

548
00:55:07,852 --> 00:55:10,020
I'm sorry.

549
00:55:11,814 --> 00:55:13,940
I think I was let off lightly.

550
00:55:14,025 --> 00:55:16,985
Did you serve your time here?

551
00:55:19,155 --> 00:55:22,074
I got to know
this motley crew quite well.

552
00:55:22,158 --> 00:55:25,994
So when they stayed, I stayed.

553
00:55:27,455 --> 00:55:29,790
Nobody else would employ me.

554
00:55:33,169 --> 00:55:36,963
So, do you still trust me
with a needle?

555
00:56:54,542 --> 00:56:57,669
Once again, this is rumor control.

556
00:56:57,754 --> 00:57:00,255
Here are the facts.

557
00:57:00,339 --> 00:57:03,008
At 0800 hours,
prisoner Murphy,

558
00:57:03,092 --> 00:57:05,969
through carelessness on his part,

559
00:57:06,053 --> 00:57:08,847
was found dead in vent shaft 17.

560
00:57:08,931 --> 00:57:11,475
He seems to have been
sucked into a ventilator fan.

561
00:57:14,947 --> 00:57:17,699
At about 2100 hours,

562
00:57:17,783 --> 00:57:21,911
prisoner Golic reappeared
in a deranged state.

563
00:57:21,996 --> 00:57:24,289
Prisoners Boggs and Rains are missing.

564
00:57:24,373 --> 00:57:29,043
There seems to be a good chance
that they have met with foul play...

565
00:57:29,128 --> 00:57:32,380
at the hands of prisoner Golic.

566
00:57:34,341 --> 00:57:37,177
We need to organize
and send out a search party.

567
00:57:39,013 --> 00:57:41,890
Volunteers will be appreciated.

568
00:57:44,477 --> 00:57:48,646
I think it's fair to say
that our smoothly running facility...

569
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:51,566
has suddenly developed
a few problems.

570
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:57,530
I can only hope we are able to all
pull together over the next few days...

571
00:57:57,615 --> 00:58:00,825
until the rescue team arrives
for Lieutenant Ripley.

572
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:02,869
It's here! It got Clemens!

573
00:58:02,953 --> 00:58:06,664
- Stop this raving at once! Stop it!
- I'm telling you, it's here!

574
00:58:06,749 --> 00:58:09,667
Aaron, get that foolish woman
back to the infirmary!

575
00:58:12,963 --> 00:58:14,923
Move it!

576
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:17,600
Out of my way!

577
00:58:21,229 --> 00:58:23,230
Fuck!

578
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:33,324
What do we do now?
Who's in charge?

579
00:58:33,408 --> 00:58:35,910
Organize. We gotta organize, right?

580
00:58:35,994 --> 00:58:38,704
Right. Well, I guess
I'm next in line.

581
00:58:38,789 --> 00:58:42,375
- 85's gonna be in charge.
Jesus, give us a break!
- Don't call me that.

582
00:58:42,459 --> 00:58:44,835
Okay, look. There's no way
I can replace Andrews.

583
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:47,630
He was a good man.
I know you guys didn't appreciate him.

584
00:58:47,714 --> 00:58:50,883
Aaron, we don't want
to hear that shit now.

585
00:58:50,968 --> 00:58:54,011
Hey, sister, what about you?
You're an officer.

586
00:58:54,096 --> 00:58:56,013
How about showing us
a little leadership?

587
00:58:56,098 --> 00:58:58,057
Forget fucking Shirley Temple.
You take charge.

588
00:58:58,141 --> 00:59:00,393
- Right.
- You run things here anyway.

589
00:59:00,477 --> 00:59:05,481
No fuckin' way.
I'm not the officer type.

590
00:59:06,566 --> 00:59:08,734
I just take care of my own.

591
00:59:08,819 --> 00:59:12,029
Well, what does
this fucking beast want?

592
00:59:14,157 --> 00:59:16,075
Is this mother
gonna try for us all?

593
00:59:19,454 --> 00:59:22,039
- Yeah.
- Well, ain't that sweet?

594
00:59:22,124 --> 00:59:24,917
- So how are we gonna stop it?

595
00:59:28,463 --> 00:59:31,257
- We have no weapons.
Is that correct?
- Right.

596
00:59:31,341 --> 00:59:35,052
I haven't seen one
exactly like this before.

597
00:59:35,137 --> 00:59:37,596
Moves differently.

598
00:59:39,683 --> 00:59:42,184
But the others
were afraid of fire-

599
00:59:42,269 --> 00:59:44,270
not much else.

600
00:59:45,564 --> 00:59:48,733
- Can we seal off this area?
- No chance.

601
00:59:48,817 --> 00:59:50,985
The installation's 10 miles square.

602
00:59:51,111 --> 00:59:53,362
There's 600 air ducts
running to the surface.
What about video?

603
00:59:53,447 --> 00:59:57,158
I see these closed-circuit monitors everywhere.
We could try to find it that way.

604
00:59:57,242 --> 01:00:01,370
The video system hasn't worked in years.
Nothing much works here.

605
01:00:01,455 --> 01:00:03,664
We got a lot of technology,
no way to fix it.

606
01:00:03,749 --> 01:00:06,167
- What 85 is trying to tell you is-
- Don't call me that!

607
01:00:06,251 --> 01:00:09,336
we ain't got no entertainment center,
no climate control,

608
01:00:09,421 --> 01:00:12,006
no video system,
no surveillance,

609
01:00:12,090 --> 01:00:15,593
no freezers, no fucking ice cream,

610
01:00:15,677 --> 01:00:18,471
no rubbers, no women, no guns.

611
01:00:18,555 --> 01:00:20,639
All we got here is shit!

612
01:00:20,724 --> 01:00:23,434
Oh, what the hell are we
even talking to her for?

613
01:00:23,518 --> 01:00:25,895
She's the one
that brought the fucker.

614
01:00:25,979 --> 01:00:30,274
Why don't we just get her head
and shove it through the fucking wall?

615
01:00:30,984 --> 01:00:32,985
Hey, Morse.

616
01:00:36,865 --> 01:00:39,116
Why don't you shut the fuck up?

617
01:00:40,285 --> 01:00:42,286
Hmm.

618
01:00:45,082 --> 01:00:47,083
Right.

619
01:00:48,085 --> 01:00:51,128
Right. What are we going to do?

620
01:01:05,650 --> 01:01:08,109
What's this?
Um,

621
01:01:08,194 --> 01:01:11,279
that leads from the mess hall
to the infirmary.

622
01:01:11,364 --> 01:01:13,365
It's a ventilation shaft.

623
01:01:13,449 --> 01:01:16,785
Then we go in there, flush it out.

624
01:01:16,869 --> 01:01:20,872
Hey. Hey, look, there's miles and miles
of tunnel through there.

625
01:01:21,874 --> 01:01:23,875
It won't go far.

626
01:01:24,919 --> 01:01:27,212
It'll nest in this area.

627
01:01:27,296 --> 01:01:29,297
Right around...

628
01:01:30,299 --> 01:01:33,802
here.
How do you know that?

629
01:01:35,054 --> 01:01:37,597
It's like a lion.

630
01:01:37,682 --> 01:01:39,891
It sticks close to the zebras.

631
01:01:39,975 --> 01:01:42,394
Zebras? Oh, right.

632
01:01:42,478 --> 01:01:45,146
But, look. Running around down here
in the dark- Are you kidding?

633
01:01:45,231 --> 01:01:47,607
Once you get out of this main shaft,
there's no overheads.

634
01:01:47,733 --> 01:01:50,860
Don't we have flashlights?
We got thousands of 'em,
but no batteries.

635
01:01:50,986 --> 01:01:53,780
I told you, nothing works.
Torches?

636
01:01:53,864 --> 01:01:56,866
Do we have the capacity
to make fire?

637
01:01:56,951 --> 01:02:00,245
Most humans have enjoyed that privilege
since the Stone Age.

638
01:02:01,330 --> 01:02:03,581
No need to be sarcastic.

639
01:02:05,334 --> 01:02:09,254
Never been used. They were gonna
dump a lot of nuclear crap in there.

640
01:02:09,338 --> 01:02:12,465
Never got around to it.
It's clean as a whistle inside.

641
01:02:12,550 --> 01:02:15,009
This the only way in or out?

642
01:02:15,094 --> 01:02:18,847
That's right. Walls are
six feet thick, solid steel.

643
01:02:18,931 --> 01:02:21,349
Really knew how
to build these babies.

644
01:02:21,434 --> 01:02:24,352
You're saying we get
something in there,

645
01:02:24,437 --> 01:02:26,896
there's no way it can get out?

646
01:02:26,981 --> 01:02:30,233
That's right. No fucking way.

647
01:02:37,199 --> 01:02:39,576
This is where we keep it.
I forget what the stuff's called.

648
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:43,163
Quinitricetyline.
I knew that.

649
01:02:43,247 --> 01:02:46,499
Right. I've got to get these section
arrangements organized with Dillon...

650
01:02:46,584 --> 01:02:49,210
for the paintbrush, uh-

651
01:02:49,295 --> 01:02:51,671
So, um-
David.

652
01:02:51,797 --> 01:02:55,842
Yeah. You can get
these drums organized.
Right, 85.

653
01:02:55,926 --> 01:02:59,304
And, uh, don't call me that.

654
01:03:01,807 --> 01:03:05,727
What's this "85" thing?

655
01:03:05,811 --> 01:03:09,105
Couple of us sneaked a look at
his personnel file the day he arrived.

656
01:03:09,190 --> 01:03:11,191
It's his I.Q.

657
01:03:18,324 --> 01:03:20,450
I saw a drum of this stuff...

658
01:03:20,534 --> 01:03:22,702
fall into a beachhead bunker once.

659
01:03:22,787 --> 01:03:26,247
The blast put a tug
in dry dock for 17 weeks.

660
01:03:26,332 --> 01:03:27,123
Great stuff!

661
01:03:32,889 --> 01:03:35,933
All right.
Let me get this straight.

662
01:03:36,017 --> 01:03:39,436
You want to burn it down
and out of the pipes,

663
01:03:39,521 --> 01:03:41,688
force it in here,
slam the door...

664
01:03:41,773 --> 01:03:44,399
and trap its ass?
Right.

665
01:03:44,484 --> 01:03:48,320
And you want help
from us y-chromo boys, huh?

666
01:03:48,404 --> 01:03:50,280
You got something better to do?

667
01:03:50,365 --> 01:03:53,158
Why should we put our ass
on the line for you?

668
01:03:53,243 --> 01:03:55,410
Your ass is already on the line.

669
01:03:55,495 --> 01:03:57,121
The only question is...

670
01:03:57,205 --> 01:03:59,623
what are you gonna do about it?

671
01:04:09,717 --> 01:04:12,219
What is this stuff?

672
01:04:13,429 --> 01:04:15,389
Man, this stuff stinks.

673
01:04:25,567 --> 01:04:27,818
So you miss Doc, right?

674
01:04:30,530 --> 01:04:33,031
What makes you say that?

675
01:04:33,116 --> 01:04:35,450
I thought you two got real close.

676
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:40,956
I guess you've been looking
through some keyholes.

677
01:04:41,082 --> 01:04:45,752
That's what I thought.
Oh!

678
01:04:49,257 --> 01:04:51,758
I hate this place.
I hate this place.

679
01:04:55,263 --> 01:04:57,181
Well.

680
01:04:57,265 --> 01:04:59,892
There's definitely
something in here with us.

681
01:05:02,187 --> 01:05:05,022
Okay. Don't light the fire
until I give the signal.

682
01:05:05,106 --> 01:05:07,649
This is the signal.

683
01:05:07,734 --> 01:05:11,028
Got it?
Can you remember that?

684
01:05:13,323 --> 01:05:15,115
Shit!

685
01:06:07,502 --> 01:06:10,170
Buh-

686
01:06:15,718 --> 01:06:17,970
Wait for the fucking signal!

687
01:06:26,187 --> 01:06:28,230
Get down!

688
01:06:29,315 --> 01:06:31,858
Aaah!

689
01:06:31,943 --> 01:06:34,278
Come on, come on!
We gotta find the sprinklers!

690
01:06:34,362 --> 01:06:36,530
Come on!
We gotta help these guys!

691
01:06:44,872 --> 01:06:47,291
Come on! Move! Move!

692
01:06:48,543 --> 01:06:51,169
Go to the waste dump.
Don't open the doors!

693
01:07:52,565 --> 01:07:56,068
Dillon, over here.
Here's another one.

694
01:07:57,445 --> 01:08:01,114
Oh, Jesus.
This makes 10.

695
01:08:04,327 --> 01:08:06,536
Fucking great!

696
01:08:06,621 --> 01:08:09,331
Well, now what are we gonna do?

697
01:08:10,792 --> 01:08:13,752
- You okay?

698
01:08:13,878 --> 01:08:17,047
Piss on her.
The fucking thing's loose out there.
What are we gonna do?

699
01:08:17,131 --> 01:08:19,383
I just said that,
you miserable little shit!

700
01:08:19,467 --> 01:08:21,051
Come on. Cut that shit out.

701
01:08:21,177 --> 01:08:23,637
Tell your fucking bozo to shape up!

702
01:08:26,474 --> 01:08:28,809
Wh-Wh-What do you think?

703
01:08:28,893 --> 01:08:31,061
I think I have
to get to the E.E.V.

704
01:08:31,145 --> 01:08:35,273
- Why? What's up?
- I just have to use the neuroscanner.

705
01:08:36,901 --> 01:08:39,111
- You don't look so good.
- Who gives a shit how she looks?

706
01:08:39,195 --> 01:08:42,030
- What are we gonna do?
- Want a smack in the mouth,
you stupid wanker?

707
01:08:42,115 --> 01:08:44,825
Shut the fuck up
and stop causing panic!

708
01:08:44,909 --> 01:08:48,412
Panic- You're so fucking stupid,
you couldn't spell it.
Don't talk to me about panic.

709
01:08:48,496 --> 01:08:51,206
- We ought to fucking panic!
- All right.
Now shut up, both of you!

710
01:08:53,126 --> 01:08:55,377
Shut up!

711
01:09:05,346 --> 01:09:08,515
- Well, I'm out of ideas!
- Oh, surprise me.

712
01:09:10,935 --> 01:09:13,437
What about outside?
Great idea.

713
01:09:13,521 --> 01:09:15,981
Sun don't come up
for another two days.
It's 40 below zero.

714
01:09:16,065 --> 01:09:18,859
The rescue team's 10 hours away.
So that makes a lot of sense!

715
01:09:18,943 --> 01:09:21,945
Wonderful. You just want us to stay here
and let this thing have us for lunch!

716
01:09:22,029 --> 01:09:25,407
I want you to get everybody
that's still left together.

717
01:09:25,491 --> 01:09:28,285
- Come down to the furnace.
- Okay.

718
01:09:59,233 --> 01:10:03,111
- Need any help?

719
01:10:03,196 --> 01:10:07,157
I don't mean to scare you.

720
01:10:07,241 --> 01:10:09,534
You shouldn't be
wandering around alone.

721
01:10:09,619 --> 01:10:12,787
Do me a favor and run
this keyboard, will you?

722
01:10:14,624 --> 01:10:16,291
Okay.

723
01:10:26,761 --> 01:10:29,012
What do I do?
Hit "B" or "C."

724
01:10:29,096 --> 01:10:30,722
What's "C"?

725
01:10:30,848 --> 01:10:32,516
"Display biofunctions."
That's it.

726
01:10:36,357 --> 01:10:39,025
Okay, we're hot. Now what?

727
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:41,695
Let it run a cycle.

728
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:43,905
It's real fuzzy.

729
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:47,075
Hit "enhancement."

730
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:07,429
Keep looking.

731
01:11:14,729 --> 01:11:16,646
I don't know how to read this stuff.

732
01:11:16,731 --> 01:11:20,233
Hemorrhaging will show as a dark patch.

733
01:11:25,907 --> 01:11:28,491
Look for...

734
01:11:28,576 --> 01:11:31,411
hairline fractures
through the base of the skull.

735
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:33,663
Little white lines.

736
01:11:41,923 --> 01:11:43,840
What is it?

737
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:47,427
I think you've got one inside of you.

738
01:11:49,472 --> 01:11:52,307
That's not possible.

739
01:11:55,061 --> 01:11:57,479
What does it look like?

740
01:12:02,026 --> 01:12:06,029
- Horrible.
- I have to see it.

741
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:10,492
- Freeze it.
- You don't want to look at it.

742
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:12,494
Freeze it!

743
01:12:37,985 --> 01:12:40,153
I'm sorry.

744
01:12:47,454 --> 01:12:51,040
It's up. What do you want to say?

745
01:12:52,625 --> 01:12:54,460
Tell them the whole place
has gone toxic.

746
01:12:54,544 --> 01:12:57,254
Are you kidding?

747
01:12:57,338 --> 01:12:59,798
Then they won't come here.
The rescue team will turn back.

748
01:12:59,924 --> 01:13:02,468
Yeah. I know.
What are you talking about?

749
01:13:02,552 --> 01:13:06,388
Our only hope is that
they kill this fucker.

750
01:13:06,473 --> 01:13:09,725
And maybe they can do something for you.
I don't know, freeze you-

751
01:13:09,809 --> 01:13:12,144
They can do an operation.
They've got the technology.

752
01:13:12,228 --> 01:13:16,023
If this organism gets off the planet,
it'll kill everything.

753
01:13:16,107 --> 01:13:18,400
The company doesn't care about that.

754
01:13:18,485 --> 01:13:21,445
They just want it for
their bioweapons division, okay?

755
01:13:21,529 --> 01:13:25,240
So we can't let them come here.

756
01:13:25,325 --> 01:13:27,409
Fuck you.

757
01:13:27,494 --> 01:13:31,246
Look, I'm sorry you've got this thing
inside you, but I'm getting rescued.

758
01:13:31,331 --> 01:13:34,750
I don't give a shit about these
stupid prisoners, but I've got a wife, a kid.

759
01:13:34,834 --> 01:13:37,836
- I'll go home on the next rotation!
- I know. This is hard.

760
01:13:37,921 --> 01:13:41,590
I'm gonna send this message.
I need that fucking code.

761
01:13:41,674 --> 01:13:44,676
I'm sorry, babe. It's classified.

762
01:13:44,761 --> 01:13:47,554
Listen, you stupid little shit!
This has got to be done, okay?

763
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:50,099
There are no alternatives!
No way!

764
01:13:50,183 --> 01:13:53,268
You're not getting it!
No fucking way!

765
01:13:59,776 --> 01:14:01,944
Look, it's nothing personal.

766
01:14:02,028 --> 01:14:04,530
Understand?

767
01:14:04,614 --> 01:14:06,698
I think you're okay.

768
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:09,618
Ah.

769
01:14:12,038 --> 01:14:13,539
Thanks.

770
01:14:22,094 --> 01:14:24,262
Have you got any ideas?
I don't know.

771
01:14:24,346 --> 01:14:28,975
Maybe I'll go find it.
See how smart it is.

772
01:14:29,101 --> 01:14:33,313
You're gonna go
and look for it?
Yeah.

773
01:14:33,397 --> 01:14:36,274
I have a pretty good idea
of where it is.

774
01:14:36,358 --> 01:14:41,237
It's just down there... in the basement.

775
01:14:41,363 --> 01:14:44,908
This whole place is a basement.

776
01:14:44,992 --> 01:14:49,704
It's a metaphor. Wanna come?

777
01:14:52,458 --> 01:14:57,587
Fuck me.

778
01:16:18,252 --> 01:16:20,086
Where are you when I need you?

779
01:16:52,795 --> 01:16:55,047
Don't be afraid.

780
01:16:57,258 --> 01:16:59,259
I'm part of the family.

781
01:18:06,285 --> 01:18:09,329
You've been in my life so long,

782
01:18:09,413 --> 01:18:11,957
I can't remember anything else.

783
01:18:14,210 --> 01:18:16,336
Now do something for me.

784
01:18:18,172 --> 01:18:20,132
It's easy.

785
01:18:20,216 --> 01:18:23,009
Just-

786
01:18:23,094 --> 01:18:25,929
Just do what you do.

787
01:19:00,631 --> 01:19:03,049
Oh!

788
01:19:10,184 --> 01:19:14,062
- It won't kill me.
- What are you doing out here?
You're supposed to be laying low.

789
01:19:14,147 --> 01:19:16,148
I have one inside of me.

790
01:19:18,443 --> 01:19:22,404
What are you talking about?
I saw it... on the CAT scan.

791
01:19:23,781 --> 01:19:28,326
It's a queen- an egg layer.

792
01:19:28,411 --> 01:19:30,454
It can make thousands more
like the one we've got here.

793
01:19:30,538 --> 01:19:35,250
Still sounds like bullshit to me.

794
01:19:35,334 --> 01:19:37,169
If that thing's inside you,
how'd it get there?

795
01:19:37,253 --> 01:19:41,590
I don't know.

796
01:19:41,674 --> 01:19:44,009
When I was in hypersleep, I guess.

797
01:19:45,386 --> 01:19:49,097
I don't have much time,

798
01:19:49,182 --> 01:19:51,725
and I can't do what I should.

799
01:19:54,061 --> 01:19:56,188
I need you to help me.

800
01:19:59,984 --> 01:20:02,777
I need you to kill me.

801
01:20:02,862 --> 01:20:06,531
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- I'm dead anyway.

802
01:20:06,616 --> 01:20:10,202
I can't survive it.

803
01:20:10,286 --> 01:20:13,246
But the one inside of me
can generate thousands more.

804
01:20:14,874 --> 01:20:17,375
It has to die.

805
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:19,920
So somebody's gotta kill me.

806
01:20:22,507 --> 01:20:24,549
Are you up to it?

807
01:20:25,593 --> 01:20:28,595
You don't have to worry about that.

808
01:20:46,113 --> 01:20:48,156
No speeches.

809
01:20:51,369 --> 01:20:53,620
No prayers.

810
01:21:24,986 --> 01:21:27,571
- What's going on?
- I don't like losing a fight.

811
01:21:27,655 --> 01:21:29,823
Not to nobody, not to nothing.

812
01:21:29,949 --> 01:21:34,452
Fuck.
That damn thing out there
has already killed half my men,

813
01:21:34,537 --> 01:21:36,371
got the other half scared shitless.

814
01:21:36,455 --> 01:21:39,541
As long as it's alive, sister,
you're not gonna save any universe.

815
01:21:39,625 --> 01:21:41,251
You said you were gonna kill me.

816
01:21:41,335 --> 01:21:45,505
- You fucking coward!
- I want that thing!

817
01:21:45,590 --> 01:21:49,050
I want to get this thing,
and I need you to do it.

818
01:21:49,135 --> 01:21:53,346
And if it won't kill you,
then maybe that helps us fight it.

819
01:21:53,472 --> 01:21:57,434
Otherwise, fuck you!

820
01:21:59,562 --> 01:22:01,980
Dillon.

821
01:22:03,316 --> 01:22:05,150
We waste this thing,

822
01:22:06,986 --> 01:22:09,154
then you take care of me.
No problem.

823
01:22:10,489 --> 01:22:14,117
Quick, easy and painless.

824
01:22:15,536 --> 01:22:19,414
You die sitting here on your ass,
or you die out there.

825
01:22:19,498 --> 01:22:22,459
At least we take a shot.
We owe it one.

826
01:22:22,543 --> 01:22:24,502
What the fuck
are you talking about?

827
01:22:24,587 --> 01:22:26,588
I'm talkin' about killing
that big motherfucker.

828
01:22:26,672 --> 01:22:28,590
Still doesn't mean we should
go out and fight it.

829
01:22:28,674 --> 01:22:32,719
- Jesus Christ! Give us a break!
- You guys have got to be fucking nuts!

830
01:22:32,803 --> 01:22:35,430
- Look, I've got a wife and a kid.
- Nobody gives a shit about you, 85.

831
01:22:35,514 --> 01:22:38,016
You're not one of us.
You're not a believer.

832
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:40,769
- You're a fucking company man!
- Yeah, okay.

833
01:22:40,853 --> 01:22:43,647
Okay, I'm a company man
and not a fucking criminal.

834
01:22:43,731 --> 01:22:46,232
You keep telling me how dumb I am.

835
01:22:46,317 --> 01:22:48,526
WelI, I'm smart enough not to have
a life sentence on this rock!

836
01:22:48,611 --> 01:22:50,403
- Fuck you!
- Piss off, 85!

837
01:22:50,529 --> 01:22:55,116
Yeah, and I'm smart enough to wait
for some firepower to show up
before we fight this thing!

838
01:22:55,201 --> 01:22:56,868
Right, Morse?

839
01:22:56,952 --> 01:22:59,663
Right. Okay. Just sit here
on your asses. Fine.

840
01:22:59,747 --> 01:23:02,540
How about if I sit here on my ass?

841
01:23:02,625 --> 01:23:06,086
No problem. Oh, I forgot.

842
01:23:06,170 --> 01:23:08,129
You're the guy that's
made a deal with God...

843
01:23:08,214 --> 01:23:10,840
to live forever, huh?

844
01:23:10,925 --> 01:23:15,220
And all the rest of you pussies
can sit it out too.

845
01:23:15,304 --> 01:23:18,390
Me and her'll do all the fighting.

846
01:23:18,474 --> 01:23:21,476
Okay. But I want
the same thing as you.

847
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:24,604
I want to see it dead. I hate the fucker!
It killed my mates too!

848
01:23:24,689 --> 01:23:29,234
Why the fuck can't we wait for the company
and have some guns on our side?

849
01:23:29,318 --> 01:23:32,904
- Why do we have to go
on some fucking suicide run?
- Right.

850
01:23:32,988 --> 01:23:34,572
Because they won't kill it.

851
01:23:34,657 --> 01:23:38,201
They might kill you just for having seen it.
But they're not gonna kill it.

852
01:23:38,285 --> 01:23:42,580
That is crazy! That is horseshit!
They will not kill us!

853
01:23:45,084 --> 01:23:48,128
When they first
heard about this thing,

854
01:23:48,212 --> 01:23:50,505
it was "crew expendable."

855
01:23:50,589 --> 01:23:55,301
The next time they sent in marines.
They were expendable too.

856
01:23:55,386 --> 01:23:59,222
What makes you think they're
gonna care about a bunch of lifers...

857
01:23:59,306 --> 01:24:03,226
who found God at the ass end of space?

858
01:24:03,310 --> 01:24:05,645
You really think
they're going to let you...

859
01:24:05,730 --> 01:24:07,981
interfere with their plans for this thing?

860
01:24:09,150 --> 01:24:11,735
They think we're- we're crud.

861
01:24:11,819 --> 01:24:15,155
And they don't give a fuck
about one friend of yours...

862
01:24:15,239 --> 01:24:17,449
that's- that's died.

863
01:24:17,533 --> 01:24:19,284
Not one.

864
01:24:23,372 --> 01:24:25,415
Have you got some sort of plan?

865
01:24:25,499 --> 01:24:28,293
This is a lead works, isn't it?

866
01:24:28,377 --> 01:24:32,422
All we got to do is lure
the fucking beast into the mold,

867
01:24:32,506 --> 01:24:34,716
drown it in hot lead.

868
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:37,927
All right. So how do we do that?

869
01:24:38,012 --> 01:24:41,306
Yeah. What are we gonna use for bait?

870
01:24:47,646 --> 01:24:53,067
- Oh, fuck!
- You're all gonna die.

871
01:24:53,152 --> 01:24:55,987
Only question is how you check out.

872
01:24:57,823 --> 01:25:00,784
Do you want it on your feet...

873
01:25:00,868 --> 01:25:04,662
or on your fucking knees, begging?

874
01:25:04,747 --> 01:25:07,248
I ain't much for begging.

875
01:25:07,333 --> 01:25:10,168
Nobody ever gave me nothin'.

876
01:25:10,252 --> 01:25:13,546
So I say fuck that thing!
Let's fight it!

877
01:25:19,011 --> 01:25:22,013
Fuck it! Let's go for it!

878
01:25:25,518 --> 01:25:29,270
Let's kick its fucking ass.
What if it runs at us?

879
01:25:29,355 --> 01:25:31,856
That's a fucking good idea.

880
01:25:35,444 --> 01:25:39,197
Channel "A," Door 1 open.

881
01:25:39,281 --> 01:25:41,533
When was the last time
you used this place?

882
01:25:41,617 --> 01:25:43,785
We fired it up five, six years ago.

883
01:25:43,869 --> 01:25:45,787
You sure the piston's
gonna work?

884
01:25:45,871 --> 01:25:48,206
There's nothing for sure
in this place.

885
01:25:53,003 --> 01:25:56,297
We trap it here first,
then you pull the lever, start the piston.

886
01:25:56,382 --> 01:25:58,925
Then the piston's gonna push
the motherfucker right into the mold.

887
01:25:59,009 --> 01:26:02,762
Then one of the guys will pour the lead.
End of his ass. End of story.

888
01:26:02,847 --> 01:26:05,640
- What if somebody screws it up?
- We're fucked. You got one chance.

889
01:26:05,724 --> 01:26:08,560
One shot at it. That's all.

890
01:26:08,644 --> 01:26:13,147
We'll never have time to reset it.
Now remember, when you pull the lever,

891
01:26:13,232 --> 01:26:17,443
for a few seconds you're gonna be
trapped in here with that fuckin' thing.

892
01:26:17,528 --> 01:26:19,654
If you guys
don't drop the ball, I won't.

893
01:26:19,738 --> 01:26:22,657
Well, you just better be right about
that thing not wanting you.

894
01:26:22,741 --> 01:26:25,493
Because if it wants out,
that's how it's gonna go.

895
01:26:25,578 --> 01:26:28,454
Through that alcove, through you.

896
01:26:28,581 --> 01:26:31,207
Where are you gonna be?
I'll be around.

897
01:26:31,292 --> 01:26:35,003
- What about the others?
Where are they?
- Praying.

898
01:26:37,548 --> 01:26:39,549
I have a problem with this.
What part?

899
01:26:39,633 --> 01:26:43,803
The part where we're running
around in a dark fucking maze
with that thing chasing us.

900
01:26:43,888 --> 01:26:46,848
You'll lead it down channel "B"
to the piston chamber.

901
01:26:46,932 --> 01:26:49,434
I'll close
the doors behind you.

902
01:26:49,518 --> 01:26:51,394
Channel "J."

903
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:54,772
Door 8 open.
Hey! What if it
won't cooperate?

904
01:26:54,857 --> 01:26:57,317
What if we get lost?

905
01:27:01,739 --> 01:27:03,781
This was her idea.

906
01:27:14,585 --> 01:27:18,087
Channel "B," Door 7.

907
01:27:19,089 --> 01:27:22,383
I don't know about this shit.

908
01:27:22,468 --> 01:27:27,972
- Hey, guys! My door ain't working!
- What the fuck's he saying?

909
01:27:28,057 --> 01:27:31,309
I think we'd better rethink this thing!

910
01:27:42,029 --> 01:27:45,365
Did anybody hear anything?

911
01:27:56,126 --> 01:27:59,295
Come on!
Come and get me, you fucker!

912
01:28:00,673 --> 01:28:02,674
It's behind me!

913
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:07,387
- It's starting.
- Still behind me!

914
01:28:07,471 --> 01:28:10,098
It's in channel "B"!

915
01:28:10,182 --> 01:28:13,685
Still coming! Shut the doors!

916
01:28:13,769 --> 01:28:16,354
Must be heading over to channel "A"!

917
01:28:21,235 --> 01:28:23,861
This thing is really pissed off!

918
01:28:23,946 --> 01:28:26,364
Did you say "B"?
No, "E"!

919
01:28:26,490 --> 01:28:28,700
But you said we should stay here!
Move your fucking ass!

920
01:28:29,994 --> 01:28:31,661
Morse?

921
01:28:34,456 --> 01:28:36,708
Kevin!

922
01:28:46,218 --> 01:28:49,303
Yoo-hoo! Hey, fuckface!

923
01:28:49,388 --> 01:28:53,766
Come and get me!
Take your best shot!

924
01:28:58,856 --> 01:29:00,982
Kevin, where are you?

925
01:29:01,066 --> 01:29:02,734
A-7 closed.

926
01:29:07,614 --> 01:29:12,243
Open the east wing.
Door B-7 safe!

927
01:29:25,924 --> 01:29:28,217
You cool?
Yeah! Okay.
Over to "E," everybody!

928
01:29:28,302 --> 01:29:30,428
Where the fuck is "E"?
This way!

929
01:29:48,656 --> 01:29:51,867
Here. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

930
01:29:51,951 --> 01:29:53,618
Here, kitty, kitty.

931
01:29:55,329 --> 01:29:57,581
Oh, my God.

932
01:29:57,665 --> 01:30:02,252
- Oh, my- You bastard!

933
01:30:02,336 --> 01:30:07,007
It's coming! It's coming, Dillon!
Geez, it's coming!

934
01:30:07,091 --> 01:30:12,262
It's comin' after us! Shut the fucking doors!
That was the plan!

935
01:30:12,346 --> 01:30:14,681
Geez, it's on the fucking ceiling!

936
01:30:14,765 --> 01:30:19,060
Dillon! Anybody! This is not a drill!

937
01:30:19,145 --> 01:30:21,938
Kevin! Gregor!

938
01:30:22,023 --> 01:30:23,815
Where the fuck are you?

939
01:30:26,235 --> 01:30:28,487
Now I'm back in "A"!

940
01:30:31,699 --> 01:30:34,534
Shut. Come on.

941
01:30:42,376 --> 01:30:46,254
Door 3, "F" Channel closed!

942
01:30:46,339 --> 01:30:48,840
I hope.

943
01:30:48,966 --> 01:30:51,301
Fuck!

944
01:30:51,427 --> 01:30:53,053
What the fuck are you doing?
What?

945
01:30:53,179 --> 01:30:55,972
Don't hold it like that.
Hold it like this.
What the fuck-

946
01:30:56,098 --> 01:30:57,849
You'll fucking kill someone,
you fucking moron!
Ow!

947
01:31:04,607 --> 01:31:09,319
- Morse! Kevin!

948
01:31:09,403 --> 01:31:11,154
Gregor!

949
01:31:11,239 --> 01:31:15,033
All they have to do
is run down the damn corridor.

950
01:31:15,117 --> 01:31:17,035
Stay here.

951
01:31:59,620 --> 01:32:03,748
It's coming. Aw, Jesus!

952
01:32:11,799 --> 01:32:14,467
No! Don't start the piston!

953
01:32:14,552 --> 01:32:17,095
- No! We have to trap it! No!

954
01:32:17,221 --> 01:32:22,017
No! What are you doing?
It's gone! No! No.

955
01:32:22,143 --> 01:32:24,936
It's gone.

956
01:32:25,021 --> 01:32:26,938
Okay?

957
01:32:29,442 --> 01:32:31,443
Okay.

958
01:33:04,810 --> 01:33:07,604
What the heck?

959
01:33:07,688 --> 01:33:10,190
All right!

960
01:33:10,316 --> 01:33:12,859
Kevin! Don't struggle!

961
01:33:12,943 --> 01:33:15,654
- Don't move! No! Don't struggle!

962
01:33:17,448 --> 01:33:19,199
Come on. Come on, Kevin.
Come on!

963
01:33:19,325 --> 01:33:21,576
Come on! Come on!
Come on.

964
01:33:21,661 --> 01:33:24,496
- The doors.
- It's coming!

965
01:33:26,248 --> 01:33:28,208
Take the piston!

966
01:33:29,710 --> 01:33:31,628
I got ya. It's all right.

967
01:33:31,712 --> 01:33:34,297
It's okay. I got ya. It's okay.

968
01:33:34,423 --> 01:33:36,174
It's all right, Kevin.

969
01:33:37,802 --> 01:33:39,177
Kevin!

970
01:33:40,179 --> 01:33:41,805
Kevin.

971
01:33:47,561 --> 01:33:49,270
Leave him.

972
01:33:49,355 --> 01:33:51,648
Leave him. He's dead.
Lure it in.

973
01:34:05,788 --> 01:34:07,956
Shit. How much time?

974
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:09,833
I'm not sure.
Four or five minutes.

975
01:34:09,917 --> 01:34:13,962
But we've got to get it back in here
before the piston seals this place off.

976
01:34:14,046 --> 01:34:18,174
- Now, let's move it!

977
01:34:44,243 --> 01:34:47,078
- Help me!
- Jude!

978
01:34:49,331 --> 01:34:53,418
Dillon! Help me, Dillon!

979
01:34:53,502 --> 01:34:56,880
It's coming at me!

980
01:34:56,964 --> 01:35:00,091
Don't look back, Jude!
Run as fast as you fucking can!

981
01:35:00,176 --> 01:35:02,427
Help me!

982
01:35:02,511 --> 01:35:05,096
God! Please! Help!

983
01:35:21,864 --> 01:35:27,243
Channel "C," Door 3 closed.

984
01:35:29,413 --> 01:35:32,916
Jesus Christ!
Thank God you're here.

985
01:35:34,502 --> 01:35:36,920
Warder Aaron, sir.
1-3-7-5-1-2.

986
01:35:37,004 --> 01:35:40,882
- Not many of us left, sir.
- Where is Lieutenant Ripley?

987
01:35:40,966 --> 01:35:45,136
- Is she still alive?
- If she's alive, she's in the furnace.

988
01:35:46,388 --> 01:35:48,473
She's in the lead works
with the beast.

989
01:35:48,557 --> 01:35:50,642
Wouldn't wait.

990
01:36:05,241 --> 01:36:08,660
Jesus Christ. You fucker.
Scared me shitless!

991
01:36:08,744 --> 01:36:12,956
I thought you were
the fucking beast. You fuck!

992
01:36:18,420 --> 01:36:22,173
Wanker!

993
01:36:42,278 --> 01:36:45,989
Move. Come on, you bastard!

994
01:36:52,162 --> 01:36:56,124
Come on! Come on,
get out of there!

995
01:36:56,208 --> 01:36:58,543
Come here!

996
01:37:00,296 --> 01:37:02,422
Ripley, we're running out of time!

997
01:37:09,013 --> 01:37:12,682
- Ripley, where are you?

998
01:37:30,034 --> 01:37:31,576
No!

999
01:37:41,128 --> 01:37:44,130
Come on. Get out of there!

1000
01:37:44,214 --> 01:37:46,090
What the fuck is wrong with you?
No! No!

1001
01:37:46,175 --> 01:37:48,509
Let it go! Let it go!

1002
01:37:48,594 --> 01:37:51,387
- Yes! It's working!
- Scream!

1003
01:37:51,513 --> 01:37:54,223
To the piston!
Scream! Let it follow us.

1004
01:37:54,350 --> 01:37:56,434
Come on!
We got to get it
in front of the piston.

1005
01:37:56,518 --> 01:37:59,771
Get back there. It's following us!

1006
01:37:59,897 --> 01:38:02,398
Motherfucker!
Come on! Come and get us!

1007
01:38:02,483 --> 01:38:04,400
Come on!

1008
01:38:04,485 --> 01:38:06,778
Up to the door! Close it!

1009
01:38:06,862 --> 01:38:09,572
Come on, motherfucker! Come on.

1010
01:38:09,657 --> 01:38:12,825
Come on! Get the door!

1011
01:38:12,910 --> 01:38:15,912
- Get the door!
- Morse!

1012
01:38:15,996 --> 01:38:17,622
Now!
Shut it!

1013
01:38:17,706 --> 01:38:18,957
Shut it, Morse!

1014
01:38:19,917 --> 01:38:23,670
Morse, shut that door!

1015
01:38:23,754 --> 01:38:25,964
- Now!
- Shut the fucking door!

1016
01:38:28,050 --> 01:38:31,135
- I'm going for the lead!

1017
01:39:07,214 --> 01:39:09,632
- Go! Now!
- What about you?

1018
01:39:09,717 --> 01:39:13,052
- I'm staying.
- Bullshit! There's gonna be
10 tons of hot lead in there!

1019
01:39:13,178 --> 01:39:16,264
I keep telling you, I want to die!
We got a deal!

1020
01:39:16,348 --> 01:39:18,891
Remember? It dies first, then you!

1021
01:39:18,976 --> 01:39:21,686
I'm not gonna move without you!
Now get going!

1022
01:39:37,536 --> 01:39:40,288
- Dillon!
- I've got to hold it here.

1023
01:39:40,372 --> 01:39:43,332
- What about me?
- God will take care of you now, sister!

1024
01:39:43,417 --> 01:39:45,334
No!

1025
01:39:45,419 --> 01:39:47,336
Pour the lead.

1026
01:39:54,636 --> 01:39:56,554
- Fuck you.

1027
01:39:58,932 --> 01:40:04,437
Go on! Pour it, Ripley! Go on! Damn it!

1028
01:40:04,521 --> 01:40:06,981
Pour that lead, Ripley!
Pour it now!

1029
01:40:07,066 --> 01:40:10,193
Come on! Come on!
That's all you've got?

1030
01:40:10,277 --> 01:40:12,570
Is that all that you fight,
motherfucker! Come on!

1031
01:40:12,696 --> 01:40:16,115
Morse! Morse, over here!

1032
01:40:18,035 --> 01:40:20,578
- Ripley!
- Pour the lead!

1033
01:40:21,830 --> 01:40:24,207
- Pour the lead!

1034
01:40:24,291 --> 01:40:25,374
Pour it!

1035
01:41:21,306 --> 01:41:22,807
I hate bugs!

1036
01:41:49,459 --> 01:41:52,253
Ripley! It's burning hot!

1037
01:41:52,337 --> 01:41:55,798
Hit the sprinklers!

1038
01:41:55,883 --> 01:41:58,342
Douse the fucker!

1039
01:42:31,001 --> 01:42:32,543
Gotcha!

1040
01:42:33,629 --> 01:42:35,296
Yes!

1041
01:43:40,453 --> 01:43:43,998
- Don't come any closer.
- Wait. They're here to help.

1042
01:43:44,082 --> 01:43:45,624
Stay where you are!

1043
01:43:48,712 --> 01:43:52,047
- Ripley.
- Bishop.

1044
01:43:52,132 --> 01:43:54,633
I'm here to help you.
No more bullshit.

1045
01:43:54,718 --> 01:43:57,302
I just felt it move.

1046
01:43:57,387 --> 01:44:00,723
- You know who I am?
- You're a droid.

1047
01:44:00,807 --> 01:44:03,809
Same model as Bishop.
Sent by the fucking company.

1048
01:44:03,893 --> 01:44:07,938
No. I'm not the Bishop android.

1049
01:44:08,023 --> 01:44:10,274
I designed it.

1050
01:44:10,358 --> 01:44:12,860
I'm very human.

1051
01:44:12,944 --> 01:44:15,237
The company sent me here
to show you a friendly face,

1052
01:44:15,321 --> 01:44:19,074
to demonstrate
how important you are to us,

1053
01:44:19,159 --> 01:44:20,784
to me.

1054
01:44:20,869 --> 01:44:24,121
- You just want to take it back.
- We want to kill it and take you home.

1055
01:44:24,205 --> 01:44:28,709
- Bullshit.
- You're wrong.
We want to help.

1056
01:44:28,793 --> 01:44:31,712
What does that mean?

1057
01:44:31,838 --> 01:44:36,008
We're gonna take that out of you.
And keep it.

1058
01:44:36,092 --> 01:44:40,012
Can't allow it to live.
Everything we know would be in jeopardy.

1059
01:44:42,182 --> 01:44:44,433
You don't want to take it back?

1060
01:44:44,517 --> 01:44:46,310
Ripley, time is important.

1061
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:51,315
We've got a surgical bay
set up on the rescue ship. Come with me.

1062
01:44:53,693 --> 01:44:58,739
You still can have a life, children-

1063
01:45:00,450 --> 01:45:03,535
And most important,
you'll know it's dead.

1064
01:45:03,620 --> 01:45:05,996
Let me help you.

1065
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:09,541
What guarantee do I have...

1066
01:45:11,503 --> 01:45:15,756
once you've taken it out,
you'll destroy it?

1067
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:18,675
You have to trust me.

1068
01:45:23,807 --> 01:45:27,059
Please? Trust me?

1069
01:45:31,689 --> 01:45:32,689
No.

1070
01:45:43,785 --> 01:45:46,495
- What's this gonna achieve?

1071
01:45:46,579 --> 01:45:49,498
- Stop!
- Ow! Oh, Jesus!

1072
01:45:49,582 --> 01:45:52,751
Morse.

1073
01:45:55,213 --> 01:45:59,383
Will you help me?
What do you want me to do?

1074
01:46:02,512 --> 01:46:05,931
It was a mistake!
There was no need for any of it!

1075
01:46:06,015 --> 01:46:07,307
Fucking android!

1076
01:46:24,617 --> 01:46:29,079
Ripley, think of all
we could learn from it.

1077
01:46:29,164 --> 01:46:32,291
It's the chance of a lifetime!

1078
01:46:32,375 --> 01:46:37,379
You must let me have it!
It's a magnificent specimen!

1079
01:46:57,066 --> 01:46:59,818
What are you doing?

1080
01:47:03,406 --> 01:47:05,782
No!

1081
01:48:22,026 --> 01:48:25,487
Come on, you. Get going.
Oh, fuck you!

1082
01:48:31,619 --> 01:48:35,956
Ash, Captain Dallas are dead.

1083
01:48:36,040 --> 01:48:39,835
Cargo and ship destroyed.

1084
01:48:39,919 --> 01:48:43,588
I should reach the frontier
in about six weeks.

1085
01:48:43,673 --> 01:48:47,092
With a little luck,
the network will pick me up.

1086
01:48:47,176 --> 01:48:49,344
This is Ripley,

1087
01:48:49,429 --> 01:48:52,931
last survivor of the Nostromo,
signing off.
