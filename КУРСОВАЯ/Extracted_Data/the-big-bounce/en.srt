2
00:01:00,642 --> 00:01:04,476
For a long time I've been walking
down life's road with my two pals...

3
00:01:04,646 --> 00:01:07,342
...bad luck and bad choices.

4
00:01:07,515 --> 00:01:11,007
Fortunately, I'm a big believer
in new beginnings, new friends...

5
00:01:11,186 --> 00:01:13,381
...and running from my problems.

6
00:01:13,555 --> 00:01:16,524
So one day I decided to head
for the Islands.

7
00:01:16,691 --> 00:01:19,683
Aloha. My name is Jack.

8
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:27,233
Start here. All the way down the line.

9
00:01:27,402 --> 00:01:28,994
Rolling.

10
00:01:36,444 --> 00:01:40,710
Ain't gonna get no work done today with
these Menehune huggers blocking the site.

11
00:01:43,585 --> 00:01:47,453
Mr. Ritchie's gonna take care
of these assholes, chop-chop.

12
00:01:48,423 --> 00:01:53,053
I've got a hotel to build. I don't care how
many Hawaiians got their blood spilled here.

13
00:01:53,228 --> 00:01:57,028
If they so much as scratch
Mr. Ritchie's car When he shoWs, he'll shit.

14
00:01:57,198 --> 00:02:01,931
Yeah, I'll get up there. Now, take it easy
on me because I got a bad shoulder here.

15
00:02:02,103 --> 00:02:04,469
- Serve me one up.
- What are you doing?

16
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:06,800
- I'll smack one doWn Frank's throat.
- No.

17
00:02:06,975 --> 00:02:09,239
- I'm gonna hit one.
- Put your tool belt on.

18
00:02:09,411 --> 00:02:11,811
Harris, ease up.
We're just having some fun.

19
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,676
Yeah, Frank, you get back to Work.

20
00:02:15,483 --> 00:02:17,576
NoW!

21
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,385
What? Just like that? No more game?

22
00:02:20,555 --> 00:02:24,389
You'll go back to desecrating
these people's land, blowing up palm trees?

23
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:27,653
We can go bloW up palm trees later.
I just Want one pitch.

24
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:30,696
Come on, I think it's messing
with our karma.

25
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:35,260
- I need the Work.
- Yeah, you do.

26
00:02:36,137 --> 00:02:40,164
- Come on, Frank, be part of us.
- Hey, you shut up, coconut nigger.

27
00:02:40,742 --> 00:02:45,406
Did he just say "coconut nigger"? Harris,
Harris, Harris, you can't say coconut nigger.

28
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,413
- Oh, I can't?
- Well, not really in this day and age.

29
00:02:49,284 --> 00:02:50,774
- You're fired.
- Why?

30
00:02:50,952 --> 00:02:54,718
- Get off the premises.
- These aren't your premises. This is--

31
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,820
- Are you joking?
- I'm gonna kick your ass.

32
00:02:57,992 --> 00:03:00,620
- Kick my ass? This is a bat.
- It's just aluminum.

33
00:03:00,795 --> 00:03:02,422
- Just a Wimp.
- Threatening me?

34
00:03:02,597 --> 00:03:05,862
No, but I'll hit you because
you're really big and crazy...

35
00:03:06,034 --> 00:03:08,901
...and you're scaring me right now.
I'm gonna hit you.

36
00:03:12,741 --> 00:03:14,641
That dislocated the jaW.

37
00:03:14,809 --> 00:03:18,176
Walter, let me read you
Mr. Harris' statement.

38
00:03:19,013 --> 00:03:23,040
"l found Jack and some others playing
ball. I politely asked them to stop...

39
00:03:23,218 --> 00:03:26,187
...as Mr. Ritchie would not be happy
with this situation.

40
00:03:26,354 --> 00:03:31,291
I told Jack he Was under my supervision
When he told me to do an unprintable thing.

41
00:03:31,826 --> 00:03:36,229
So I told him to put the bat down, but he
came at me before I could defend myself."

42
00:03:36,398 --> 00:03:37,956
And got fungoed.

43
00:03:39,367 --> 00:03:42,666
- So, what do you think, judge?
- Good, quick hands.

44
00:03:43,405 --> 00:03:45,965
He's also got an interesting rap sheet.

45
00:03:46,641 --> 00:03:50,702
Got a couple of breaking and enterings,
no convictions.

46
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:55,281
He's got a bunco rap here. Suspected of
conning a police officer out of some money.

47
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:59,648
- They always wind up here, don't they?
- Hawaii is sort of the end of the line.

48
00:03:59,821 --> 00:04:01,721
They never seem to go on to Tokyo.

49
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:05,257
We ought to put him in jail,
let him Work on his sWing a bit.

50
00:04:05,427 --> 00:04:07,258
Let's just keep an eye on him.

51
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:11,195
He did manage to shut doWn
Ray Ritchie's construction site for a bit.

52
00:04:11,366 --> 00:04:12,993
Standup guy in my book.

53
00:04:14,702 --> 00:04:16,829
I hope you enjoyed your stay With us.

54
00:04:17,038 --> 00:04:20,838
Just sign that at the bottom.
Your company dropped off your paycheck...

55
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:24,740
...which ought to be a good head start
in getting you off the island.

56
00:04:27,015 --> 00:04:29,347
I had a harp, a harmonica.

57
00:04:29,517 --> 00:04:31,178
Neither one.

58
00:04:31,719 --> 00:04:33,448
A Hohner. You didn't see-- ?

59
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:36,556
Why would anyone want
a prisoner's used harmonica?

60
00:04:36,724 --> 00:04:40,125
Would you like to look back
in your cell for 30 more days for it?

61
00:04:40,295 --> 00:04:41,956
No, I Wouldn't.

62
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,394
You can pick a new one
up at Waialua--

63
00:04:44,566 --> 00:04:49,060
Why don't you buy one in Honolulu, sport.
I'll put you on the Pearl Shuttle today.

64
00:04:49,304 --> 00:04:52,068
That's all right. I'll see you.

65
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,832
Better not.

66
00:05:09,924 --> 00:05:11,653
NoW What?

67
00:05:11,826 --> 00:05:15,159
You don't work for me anymore,
so I don't have to help you out.

68
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,920
Fair enough.

69
00:05:17,098 --> 00:05:19,498
I will tell you something
for your own good.

70
00:05:20,268 --> 00:05:21,929
Go back to the mainland.

71
00:05:22,103 --> 00:05:27,040
What, miss the big surf season?
Are you crazy? I live for these big waves.

72
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:30,609
You club a foreman in front of his men,
someone will knife you...

73
00:05:30,778 --> 00:05:32,871
...so fast you won't even feel it.

74
00:05:33,047 --> 00:05:36,608
Well, I got a long Walk ahead of me.
Thanks for the tip, Bob Jr.

75
00:05:36,784 --> 00:05:38,149
I'll be seeing you around.

76
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:41,584
Jack, Mr. Ritchie got you out
because We got a hotel to build.

77
00:05:41,756 --> 00:05:44,782
And it won't get built with
all the workers in courtrooms.

78
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:50,522
The quicker you shut up, the quicker
I'm gone. I got a long Walk ahead of me.

79
00:05:52,233 --> 00:05:53,700
And then you're out of here?

80
00:05:53,868 --> 00:05:57,065
- I'm gone.
- I'll give you a ride to your truck.

81
00:05:57,238 --> 00:06:00,036
Now you're talking.
You'd have been a big hit in jail.

82
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:01,573
- Don't touch me.
- Seriously.

83
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:26,066
Nancy.

84
00:06:28,736 --> 00:06:31,170
Come on, I got a lot to do today.

85
00:06:33,608 --> 00:06:37,100
What do you want me to do when
your wife comes back from Honolulu?

86
00:06:37,278 --> 00:06:38,540
You go to the lodge.

87
00:06:38,713 --> 00:06:42,171
What, slip out the back door
as she comes in the front? Like this?

88
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,874
I'll be back next Thursday.

89
00:06:44,052 --> 00:06:48,785
If you don't like this, Bob Jr. can drive you
past Cane Haul Road, where you came from.

90
00:06:48,957 --> 00:06:52,449
Well, it's nice to know
you can't live without me, Ray.

91
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,254
Did I make any promises to you?

92
00:06:55,863 --> 00:06:58,229
We're clear?
Do I owe you anything?

93
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:00,663
Ray Ritchie, always the businessman.

94
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,765
You're a cute kid, Nancy.

95
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:08,375
If I had to replace you,
it'd probably take me most of the day.

96
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,774
Think I don't know
you're up to something?

97
00:07:15,049 --> 00:07:17,074
Who are you fooling with?

98
00:07:17,652 --> 00:07:19,517
You, Ray.

99
00:07:20,688 --> 00:07:24,715
Get dressed. You're coming with me.
Hurry up, get your skinny ass moving.

100
00:07:25,126 --> 00:07:27,151
Come on, I don't have all day.

101
00:07:42,377 --> 00:07:45,210
- Hey, there he is!
- Yeah, he's our brother!

102
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,608
Show them, man.

103
00:07:46,781 --> 00:07:48,043
Give the man a bat.

104
00:07:48,616 --> 00:07:50,481
Brother, you the man.

105
00:08:01,896 --> 00:08:03,557
Yeah.

106
00:08:07,068 --> 00:08:09,832
You missed a spot. Beat it, Frank.

107
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:16,037
I'm taking The Alison out for a cruise.
We'll moor it in Lanikuhonua.

108
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:19,236
- Then I'm heading to Honolulu.
- Excellent.

109
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,775
- ls that him?
- Yes, sir.

110
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:24,417
- He's been arrested before, huh?
- A few times.

111
00:08:24,585 --> 00:08:28,521
- What for?
- Various scams. B and E, mostly.

112
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,681
What's "B and E"?

113
00:08:31,025 --> 00:08:32,959
Breaking and entering.

114
00:08:33,227 --> 00:08:35,218
That ought to turn you on.

115
00:08:58,152 --> 00:09:01,713
Mr. Ritchie, you Want to get rid of me
bad enough to give me a lift?

116
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:03,720
Sure, cowboy.

117
00:09:04,592 --> 00:09:07,356
But not bad enough to drive
with you to Honolulu.

118
00:09:07,528 --> 00:09:09,428
Mahalo, anyway.

119
00:09:40,294 --> 00:09:43,422
- Dude, Wait till I tell you What I found.
- No, pass.

120
00:09:44,265 --> 00:09:47,393
- What do you mean? I didn't say anything.
- I'm semi-retired.

121
00:09:47,568 --> 00:09:51,060
- I know what you're gonna say.
- No. What you are is out of a job.

122
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:55,266
This is the place I've been telling you
about, and I can't do it without you.

123
00:09:55,443 --> 00:10:00,676
Let me explain it simply. I just did a short
visit to jail. That's enough for a while.

124
00:10:00,848 --> 00:10:05,114
- lt Was a pain in the ass. I'm taking a break.
- I've been casing this all summer.

125
00:10:05,286 --> 00:10:08,881
Don't make me waste that work.
One quick look, that's all I'm asking.

126
00:10:09,056 --> 00:10:10,751
We're talking about a fat goose.

127
00:10:10,925 --> 00:10:13,723
Hear what I'm saying?
You're looking at the new me.

128
00:10:13,895 --> 00:10:15,590
Come on. Come take a look.

129
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,429
- You still oWe Harris money?
- I don't Wanna talk about that.

130
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,433
I'm gonna take one look.
Would you do it for me?

131
00:10:22,603 --> 00:10:25,037
- I would do it for you.
- Okay.

132
00:10:25,206 --> 00:10:29,006
- Okay. One look. One look.
- Beautiful.

133
00:10:37,685 --> 00:10:39,653
- What do you think?
- How many we got?

134
00:10:39,821 --> 00:10:42,483
I count 20 cars,
but they're all doWn at the beach.

135
00:10:42,657 --> 00:10:45,717
Okay. You wait here.

136
00:10:45,893 --> 00:10:48,919
- Yes.
- Anybody comes, you still wait here.

137
00:10:49,096 --> 00:10:53,294
- Oh, what if, like, the cops come by?
- Just watch them roll by. Are you nervous?

138
00:10:53,467 --> 00:10:57,801
- Are you having second thoughts?
- I just wanna make sure I'm doing it right.

139
00:10:57,972 --> 00:11:01,135
- Everything's cool.
- Who's ever sure if it's cool?

140
00:11:01,309 --> 00:11:03,106
Let me just open--

141
00:11:04,245 --> 00:11:07,612
Bad start here.
Getting a little sloppy here.

142
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,775
What are we doing?
We're just delivering beer.

143
00:11:11,953 --> 00:11:15,445
No crime in that. Not yet, at least.
They haven't outlaWed that.

144
00:11:37,144 --> 00:11:38,736
Hello.

145
00:11:39,213 --> 00:11:41,374
You guys order some beer?

146
00:12:41,642 --> 00:12:43,269
Hey.

147
00:12:43,577 --> 00:12:46,944
Hi. Aloha. I'm Wendy
with the Haleiwa Party Planners.

148
00:12:47,114 --> 00:12:51,710
- Yeah, we thought you'd never make it.
- I know. We're just swamped today. Sorry.

149
00:12:52,386 --> 00:12:55,446
- You're a mermaid.
- Yeah, you ordered the Catch of the Day.

150
00:12:55,623 --> 00:12:57,591
Yeah, yeah. We made the right choice.

151
00:12:57,925 --> 00:13:00,450
- Flippers and all. Wow.
- Great.

152
00:13:00,628 --> 00:13:04,120
- I'll turn you loose there in the kitchen.
- Okay.

153
00:13:04,298 --> 00:13:08,291
Your flippers clean? Just the floors.
We had to give a cleaning deposit.

154
00:13:08,469 --> 00:13:10,198
- Okay.
- They look all right.

155
00:13:10,371 --> 00:13:13,499
- That little shimmering stuff looks good.
- Thanks.

156
00:13:19,313 --> 00:13:23,545
- Give it to me. Give it to me.
- Hold it, hold it, get over here.

157
00:13:23,718 --> 00:13:25,618
Give me my cut.

158
00:13:25,953 --> 00:13:28,148
You're gonna be happy With this one.

159
00:13:28,656 --> 00:13:30,089
- What is this?
- What's What?

160
00:13:30,257 --> 00:13:33,658
- Dude, this is 200. You said We made six.
- Yeah, right.

161
00:13:33,828 --> 00:13:38,060
Yeah, but 200 is your cut.
That's the going rate for hiding in the truck.

162
00:13:38,232 --> 00:13:41,929
Come on, I'm 15 in the hole to Harris.
I wasn't hiding in the truck.

163
00:13:42,103 --> 00:13:46,472
- I'm not a rich man.
- Jack, please.

164
00:13:49,243 --> 00:13:50,801
- Thanks.
- Hold it.

165
00:13:50,978 --> 00:13:52,605
Take the Wallets and the box...

166
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:56,216
...go get rid of them behind
Kammie's Market, in the dumpsters.

167
00:13:56,384 --> 00:13:58,477
Absolutely.
We should do this again soon.

168
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,211
You know, they got a video
of you batting Harris?

169
00:14:29,717 --> 00:14:31,412
- ls that right?
- Yeah.

170
00:14:31,585 --> 00:14:33,348
HoW did you happen to see it?

171
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:37,821
Well, if Harris hadn't dropped the charges,
the trial would've been in my court.

172
00:14:37,992 --> 00:14:39,823
I'm the D.J. here.

173
00:14:40,327 --> 00:14:42,693
District judge, among other things.

174
00:14:42,863 --> 00:14:46,492
I'm glad you sat down. Let me ask you,
if they dropped the charges...

175
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:50,433
- ...how come they're telling me to leave?
- Can't make you leave...

176
00:14:50,604 --> 00:14:52,697
...unless they make something up.

177
00:14:53,374 --> 00:14:55,171
There We are. Thank you.

178
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,842
What's this for?

179
00:15:00,981 --> 00:15:03,973
Chamber of commerce, welcome wagon.

180
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,887
Now, for what it's worth, kid, I think
you're better off out from under Ray Ritchie.

181
00:15:11,058 --> 00:15:15,051
- You're not a fan of Ray Ritchie's?
- Don't like the way he does things.

182
00:15:15,996 --> 00:15:18,760
See, he's supposed to be in Chapter 11.

183
00:15:18,933 --> 00:15:23,131
Any businessman knows, if you're bankrupt,
you can't afford to build that hotel.

184
00:15:23,304 --> 00:15:25,101
Are you a businessman?

185
00:15:25,272 --> 00:15:28,264
I got a little resort spot.

186
00:15:28,642 --> 00:15:30,303
Surf camp.

187
00:15:30,611 --> 00:15:34,206
I guess Ray's big, ugly hotel
Wouldn't be so great for your business.

188
00:15:34,381 --> 00:15:38,283
No, not at all.
It's just the way he treats us locals.

189
00:15:38,452 --> 00:15:41,353
You got a bunch of little cabins
over near the beach?

190
00:15:41,522 --> 00:15:43,854
Keiki Vista? Shit.

191
00:15:44,024 --> 00:15:46,254
- I've got 12 bungaloWs, my man.
- BungaloWs?

192
00:15:46,427 --> 00:15:51,421
BungaloWs. Bedroom, kitchen, bath.
The Whole Works.

193
00:15:51,599 --> 00:15:53,590
You Wanna see a pretty girl?

194
00:15:58,105 --> 00:16:01,233
She's practically undressing me
with her eyes there.

195
00:16:02,276 --> 00:16:04,642
Do you know that guy she's sitting with?

196
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:10,442
Bob Jr.? He's Ray Ritchie's flunky.
His old man and I play dominoes together.

197
00:16:10,651 --> 00:16:12,414
What's that girl's name?

198
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,778
Nancy-something.

199
00:16:14,955 --> 00:16:18,220
She's Ray's assistant.
But that's a euphemism.

200
00:16:18,392 --> 00:16:21,054
Kind of young to be a euphemism,
isn't she?

201
00:16:21,228 --> 00:16:24,254
Word of warning.
She's been in my court a couple of times.

202
00:16:24,431 --> 00:16:26,365
- This girl?
- Started young.

203
00:16:26,534 --> 00:16:28,001
Looks so sWeet.

204
00:16:28,169 --> 00:16:32,663
Yeah. One of those unfortunate girls
who's turned on by the criminal type.

205
00:16:32,973 --> 00:16:34,497
Poor girl.

206
00:16:34,842 --> 00:16:37,538
I wonder what she's doing
with Bob Jr.

207
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:44,174
Bob's old man, dumb-shit,
undersold all of his property to Ray Ritchie.

208
00:16:44,351 --> 00:16:47,013
Don't look noW,
but Dumbshit Jr.'s coming over.

209
00:16:52,059 --> 00:16:54,459
- Bob.
- Are you trying to be cute?

210
00:16:54,628 --> 00:16:57,461
Now, Junior, who can be cute
with you around?

211
00:16:57,631 --> 00:17:00,998
- This is company business, Walter.
- Does he Work for you?

212
00:17:01,168 --> 00:17:03,432
No. We paid him off,
and he agreed to leave.

213
00:17:03,604 --> 00:17:05,834
You paid him off because you oWed him.

214
00:17:06,006 --> 00:17:09,100
Now he doesn't work for you anymore.
Right? Right.

215
00:17:09,276 --> 00:17:13,212
So if he doesn't want to go anywhere,
he doesn't have to. Right? Right.

216
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,543
- Right.
- You letting him fight your battles for you?

217
00:17:16,717 --> 00:17:20,153
Yeah. Seems to be doing a good job.

218
00:17:20,554 --> 00:17:22,181
Right.

219
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:27,459
If I wasn't with someone I might just pick
your ass up and carry you out of here.

220
00:17:27,628 --> 00:17:31,325
You might have to if Walter keeps buying
me beer. I'm all liquored up.

221
00:17:31,498 --> 00:17:33,659
I'm just trying to keep my wits about me.

222
00:17:33,834 --> 00:17:37,793
Look, Junior, I invited this guy
to have a beer, and we're not done.

223
00:17:37,972 --> 00:17:42,841
We might have another one or 10 more. The
point is, you said what you came to say.

224
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,910
So now why don't you just leave.

225
00:17:49,116 --> 00:17:52,051
I get the feeling we're gonna run
into each other again.

226
00:17:52,486 --> 00:17:55,319
And one of us is gonna end up
looking like shit.

227
00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:00,818
I got a head start on you
in that department. It's not fair.

228
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,827
Your Honor.

229
00:18:10,037 --> 00:18:13,006
- Bob Jr. scare you?
- Yeah, he does.

230
00:18:13,307 --> 00:18:15,832
Not as much as that girl, though.

231
00:18:17,344 --> 00:18:18,868
Thank you, there.

232
00:18:19,046 --> 00:18:20,946
Appreciate that.

233
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:25,476
- You gonna be hanging around here?
- I don't knoW yet.

234
00:18:25,653 --> 00:18:28,247
Want to come to Work at Keiki Vista?

235
00:18:28,455 --> 00:18:31,151
I'll pay you $250-- No.

236
00:18:31,325 --> 00:18:32,587
I'll pay you...

237
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:37,254
...$300 a week and give you a place to
stay that you can fix up. You think it over.

238
00:18:48,676 --> 00:18:51,770
- Hey.
- Hey, yourself.

239
00:19:08,862 --> 00:19:11,831
Hi, I'm Number 9.

240
00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:15,430
I have a weird showerhead
that just keeps spraying everywhere.

241
00:19:15,602 --> 00:19:17,331
- Think you can fix it?
- Sure.

242
00:19:17,504 --> 00:19:20,701
I just wanna finish what I started here,
then I'll get on it.

243
00:19:20,874 --> 00:19:23,104
- Thanks.
- Thanks, Number 9.

244
00:19:30,851 --> 00:19:33,445
I Want you to check the shoWerhead
in Number 9.

245
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:37,249
I just spoke with her.
So I guess I'm the plumber also.

246
00:19:37,424 --> 00:19:40,484
And the cook and the lifeguard
before I'm through with you.

247
00:19:40,661 --> 00:19:42,458
Does Ray Ritchie live around here?

248
00:19:44,298 --> 00:19:46,892
You mean, does Nancy live around here?

249
00:19:48,435 --> 00:19:51,802
That pimp starter castle up the beach.

250
00:21:04,878 --> 00:21:08,245
Okay, call me when you get there.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

251
00:21:14,588 --> 00:21:16,419
That's great.

252
00:21:19,026 --> 00:21:21,460
Well, same to you.

253
00:21:23,096 --> 00:21:25,360
Oh, really?

254
00:21:28,302 --> 00:21:30,463
Yeah. I Was just on the phone With him.

255
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:41,673
Yeah, he's kind of interesting
in sort of a limited way, for an off night.

256
00:21:41,849 --> 00:21:45,410
Listen, I have to run.
My personal trainer just showed up.

257
00:21:45,953 --> 00:21:47,284
Mahalo.

258
00:21:47,588 --> 00:21:50,648
Sorry. I didn't mean to startle you
like that.

259
00:21:50,891 --> 00:21:53,655
You are good at this B and E thing,
aren't you?

260
00:21:53,827 --> 00:21:55,852
It's more trespassing at this point.

261
00:21:56,029 --> 00:21:59,965
So should I call the police now,
or you gonna tie me up and loot the place?

262
00:22:00,133 --> 00:22:01,600
Call the cops?

263
00:22:01,768 --> 00:22:05,169
You go to this trouble to get me here,
and now you call the cops?

264
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:07,239
A word of advice.

265
00:22:07,407 --> 00:22:10,342
If you're thinking of scamming Ray Ritchie,
think twice.

266
00:22:10,511 --> 00:22:13,674
Who said anything about scamming?
I came to see if you wanted to surf.

267
00:22:13,847 --> 00:22:16,748
- You, doWnstairs.
- Let me ask you...

268
00:22:16,917 --> 00:22:21,081
- ...why were you winking at me in the bar?
- I wasn't winking at you at the bar.

269
00:22:21,255 --> 00:22:23,553
Like hell, you didn't.

270
00:22:24,224 --> 00:22:28,456
- You get scared being here all alone?
- I'm never all alone.

271
00:22:30,697 --> 00:22:32,494
So beautiful.

272
00:22:33,367 --> 00:22:36,962
- This looks like a good one.
- No, not that one. It's too stimulating.

273
00:22:37,137 --> 00:22:39,799
- Let's do something else.
- Like What?

274
00:22:40,507 --> 00:22:44,307
Let's do something
that makes the sex better afterwards.

275
00:22:44,912 --> 00:22:48,313
Sometimes sex makes the sex
better afterwards. I'm old-fashioned.

276
00:22:48,482 --> 00:22:54,421
I don't knoW What you'd be interested in.
I'm the poor, unfortunate criminal type.

277
00:22:54,588 --> 00:22:58,115
- Yeah, you look dangerous.
- Kind of an outlaW.

278
00:22:58,292 --> 00:23:01,887
You knoW, I get into things
like stealing cars and...

279
00:23:02,062 --> 00:23:03,324
You knoW hoW?

280
00:23:03,597 --> 00:23:07,533
- Please. You Wouldn't be interested in that--
- I'll make you a deal.

281
00:23:07,701 --> 00:23:12,400
Why don't you show me how, and I'll
show you something, whatever you want.

282
00:23:12,573 --> 00:23:14,564
Like hoW to make bail?

283
00:23:19,513 --> 00:23:23,609
I'm starting to get a little nervous.
Is Ray a great boxer or something?

284
00:23:24,084 --> 00:23:25,415
Take your shoes off.

285
00:23:26,753 --> 00:23:28,448
Watch your head.

286
00:23:29,423 --> 00:23:32,256
- Don't be scared.
- This is like a--

287
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,858
Are you serious?
You really want to box?

288
00:23:36,029 --> 00:23:38,327
I Win, you shoW me hoW to steal a car.

289
00:23:38,498 --> 00:23:42,127
You Win, I do Whatever you Want.

290
00:23:42,903 --> 00:23:45,736
- Put them up.
- Did you grow up on a Marine base?

291
00:23:45,906 --> 00:23:49,535
Just don't use the
" I've never hit a girl" excuse.

292
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,007
I've never hit a girl.

293
00:23:53,814 --> 00:23:57,181
Don't be hitting me on my head
When I'm not looking.

294
00:23:57,384 --> 00:23:59,614
You've just awakened a sleeping giant.

295
00:23:59,786 --> 00:24:03,813
- Tell me everything about yourself.
- No, you first. I need to work on my D.

296
00:24:03,991 --> 00:24:07,620
Okay. I dropped out of high school,
took a trip to Hollywood...

297
00:24:07,794 --> 00:24:11,230
...went broke, came home
and hostessed at a strip club.

298
00:24:11,398 --> 00:24:14,333
Everybody hostesses. Nobody strips.

299
00:24:15,836 --> 00:24:18,304
- Too shy.
- Too shy?

300
00:24:18,538 --> 00:24:21,405
I met Ray and figured him
for an easy mark and...

301
00:24:22,609 --> 00:24:26,306
And I sort of liked him when I found out
he cheats on his taxes.

302
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,812
The arrangement Works out fine.

303
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:31,016
And you?

304
00:24:31,184 --> 00:24:33,618
You're not gonna believe it,
you told my story.

305
00:24:33,787 --> 00:24:36,551
Too shy to strip, so I Was a hostess too.

306
00:24:43,463 --> 00:24:45,454
You hit me!

307
00:24:45,632 --> 00:24:46,929
Is that alloWed?

308
00:24:47,501 --> 00:24:51,335
- "I've never hit a girl before."
- Come on, let's work on our clinches.

309
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:53,563
Let's go steal a car.

310
00:24:58,612 --> 00:25:01,877
You happy noW? We did it. Stole a car.

311
00:25:04,284 --> 00:25:05,751
- Easy.
- What do We do?

312
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,580
Be cool.

313
00:25:07,754 --> 00:25:11,520
- We're in a stolen car.
- True, but they don't knoW that.

314
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:14,389
- Hopefully.
- Hey, boys!

315
00:25:47,694 --> 00:25:49,321
Nancy?

316
00:25:51,898 --> 00:25:53,627
Nancy?

317
00:25:54,935 --> 00:25:56,732
Nancy?

318
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,669
Okay, a little cat-and-mouse.
Well, I'll play the game.

319
00:26:03,844 --> 00:26:07,280
- Nancy!
- Don't look. I'm taking my clothes off.

320
00:26:07,447 --> 00:26:10,245
I get shy at the Weirdest times.

321
00:27:04,171 --> 00:27:06,401
It's my party dress.

322
00:27:07,507 --> 00:27:08,804
Mine too.

323
00:27:10,277 --> 00:27:13,440
So is this Mr. Ritchie's boat,
The Alison?

324
00:27:13,713 --> 00:27:17,012
- Who's Alison?
- Take a Wild guess.

325
00:27:17,751 --> 00:27:22,381
Mrs. R. God, he must really love her
to name such a great boat after her.

326
00:27:22,556 --> 00:27:25,423
Come here. Come sit down next to me.

327
00:27:32,732 --> 00:27:34,495
So let's have it.

328
00:27:34,668 --> 00:27:37,296
- Have What?
- Just ask me.

329
00:27:41,942 --> 00:27:44,911
So ask me what you want to ask me.

330
00:27:45,946 --> 00:27:49,074
Okay. Have you ever stolen any money?

331
00:27:50,617 --> 00:27:53,245
I'll grab something if it's lying around.

332
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,781
What's the most you ever got?

333
00:27:56,857 --> 00:27:59,485
- Couple hundred bucks.
- Okay.

334
00:27:59,659 --> 00:28:03,686
What if I told you
there was 200,000 lying around?

335
00:28:03,864 --> 00:28:07,857
- Would you have the nerve to take it?
- We talking about Ray Ritchie's money?

336
00:28:08,034 --> 00:28:12,596
- Wouldn't that make it a little more fun?
- Where Would this 200,000 be lying around?

337
00:28:12,772 --> 00:28:16,640
In his hunting lodge,
up in the Waialua Hills.

338
00:28:18,011 --> 00:28:20,878
- What's he got the money for?
- For the local gangsters.

339
00:28:21,047 --> 00:28:25,450
He wants to make sure there are no more
protesters at the construction site.

340
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:27,610
- You folloWing?
- Yeah, I folloW you.

341
00:28:27,787 --> 00:28:31,484
- HoW do you knoW all this?
- Bob Jr. told me.

342
00:28:32,092 --> 00:28:36,392
- And the money just sits there?
- Bob Jr. will be with it.

343
00:28:36,663 --> 00:28:38,187
We'll find a way to grab it.

344
00:28:38,365 --> 00:28:41,232
Two hundred grand's a lot different
from a TV set.

345
00:28:41,401 --> 00:28:42,993
Yeah, it's Way lighter.

346
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:45,565
I'll take a look at the lodge.

347
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:47,666
Let's have a drink.

348
00:28:48,208 --> 00:28:52,770
You gotta admit this is a great boat.
I mean, even if it is called The Alison.

349
00:28:52,946 --> 00:28:55,915
Wait till you see the one
they name after me.

350
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:07,387
And I guess now we call it a night.

351
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,289
That Was fun. I had a good time.

352
00:29:09,462 --> 00:29:11,555
- Me too.
- Yeah.

353
00:29:11,731 --> 00:29:13,460
- I'll be seeing you.
- Wait, Nancy.

354
00:29:13,633 --> 00:29:17,262
I mean, you Wanna have a nightcap?

355
00:29:18,705 --> 00:29:23,506
- We could break into a house or something.
- Okay, yeah.

356
00:29:24,277 --> 00:29:27,769
If you're sure the house is empty,
why are we whispering?

357
00:29:27,948 --> 00:29:30,348
Professional courtesy.

358
00:29:30,517 --> 00:29:33,543
- What's that?
- I don't knoW, a shrunken head?

359
00:29:34,788 --> 00:29:36,050
God.

360
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:39,615
Get a room.

361
00:29:40,026 --> 00:29:41,755
And a rubber!

362
00:30:02,382 --> 00:30:05,476
- Oh, hey, Jack. How are you?
- Frank, what-- ?

363
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:09,920
- HoW'd you knoW I Was here?
- The guy outside said this Was yours.

364
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:14,993
- Did he tell you to make yourself at home?
- No, I tried the door and it was open.

365
00:30:15,161 --> 00:30:18,460
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay. I've just had a crazy day.

366
00:30:19,566 --> 00:30:23,093
Well, listen,
I hate to burden you With this, but...

367
00:30:23,269 --> 00:30:26,067
- Can I get you anything?
- Harris has these guys...

368
00:30:26,239 --> 00:30:29,470
...and they're gonna kick my ass
if I don't pay him his money.

369
00:30:29,642 --> 00:30:33,703
- What do you want me to do? Pay him.
- Harris says I know where you're hiding.

370
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:38,510
First, I'm not really hiding. Second, you
Would never tell him Where I Was hiding...

371
00:30:38,685 --> 00:30:41,620
- ...because you're my friend.
- I'm not threatening you.

372
00:30:41,788 --> 00:30:46,054
Things will get weird if it seems you're
threatening me and I'm threatening you.

373
00:30:46,226 --> 00:30:49,753
Listen, I'm desperate for this money,
and we're friends, right?

374
00:30:49,929 --> 00:30:54,559
Yeah, we're friends. But it's the type
of friendship where if you're in trouble...

375
00:30:54,734 --> 00:30:59,364
...I probably Won't be there for you just like
I Wouldn't expect you to be there for me.

376
00:30:59,539 --> 00:31:04,340
It's a more honest friendship. It's not this
phony thing. It's like a genuine friendship.

377
00:31:04,511 --> 00:31:08,242
I can't trust you. You can't trust me.
I'm not taking a bullet for you.

378
00:31:08,415 --> 00:31:12,511
- I'm not gonna jump on a grenade for you.
- Jack, Jack, cut the shit, Will you?

379
00:31:13,787 --> 00:31:16,347
- HoW much do you oWe Harris?
- Fifteen hundred.

380
00:31:16,523 --> 00:31:18,753
Dollars? You think I got 1500?

381
00:31:18,925 --> 00:31:21,894
No, no, but you knoW
hoW to get that kind of money.

382
00:31:23,196 --> 00:31:24,561
Okay.

383
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:27,733
I got one thing I'm working on.
Maybe I can work you in.

384
00:31:27,901 --> 00:31:30,927
Yes, please. Thank you.
Thank you so much. Thanks.

385
00:31:31,104 --> 00:31:33,072
Wait, you wanna tell me
about it now?

386
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:36,800
- I'm Working out details. I'll surprise you.
- Thanks. Thanks, man.

387
00:31:52,325 --> 00:31:53,917
Bravo!

388
00:31:56,362 --> 00:31:58,956
Hey, you went flying off there that time.

389
00:31:59,132 --> 00:32:01,965
- Mahalo.
- Very good dive.

390
00:32:02,135 --> 00:32:05,662
- Appreciate that, Walter.
- Pretty high up there, isn't it?

391
00:32:06,072 --> 00:32:07,664
Well, you ready to try it?

392
00:32:07,841 --> 00:32:12,801
Me? No, I wanna give my food
a chance to settle before I get up there.

393
00:32:13,813 --> 00:32:15,804
Oh, boy, look at that.

394
00:32:16,683 --> 00:32:18,548
Figured out your day off?

395
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,181
Yeah, I Was thinking about maybe Friday.

396
00:32:22,355 --> 00:32:24,346
- No, I need you Friday.
- What?

397
00:32:24,524 --> 00:32:27,186
- I've got a meeting.
- What do you got a meeting on?

398
00:32:29,762 --> 00:32:31,423
None of your business.

399
00:32:34,601 --> 00:32:36,432
So tomorrow's better than Friday?

400
00:32:38,071 --> 00:32:39,368
Yeah.

401
00:32:41,341 --> 00:32:43,969
So I hear you found a new friend.

402
00:32:45,078 --> 00:32:47,273
You mean Nancy? No.

403
00:32:47,614 --> 00:32:49,445
She belongs to Ray Ritchie.

404
00:32:49,782 --> 00:32:54,014
- Well, I didn't think he'd given her to you.
- No, she's still Ritchie's.

405
00:32:55,755 --> 00:32:57,552
As long as you remember.

406
00:32:58,825 --> 00:33:00,759
Pretty girl, though.

407
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:16,169
This house, there's no neWspaper out front,
Which makes me think that they're home.

408
00:33:16,342 --> 00:33:18,071
Over at that house...

409
00:33:18,244 --> 00:33:22,442
That house is definitely occupied.
Judging from the car, it's an elderly couple.

410
00:33:22,615 --> 00:33:25,448
I get along really well
with my grandmother.

411
00:33:25,618 --> 00:33:28,212
You do? Yeah, me too.
Okay, we'll skip that house.

412
00:33:28,388 --> 00:33:32,347
Then off in the distance, we got
a little happy-hour get-together going on.

413
00:33:32,525 --> 00:33:36,791
Obviously, we're gonna pass. So I think
we're gonna find an empty house.

414
00:33:37,263 --> 00:33:38,696
Where's the rush?

415
00:33:53,646 --> 00:33:56,046
What are you gonna say
if someone comes?

416
00:33:56,716 --> 00:33:58,946
Are the Ambruzazaolas here?

417
00:33:59,118 --> 00:34:01,382
What if that's their name?

418
00:34:01,554 --> 00:34:03,112
- Ambruzazaola?
- Yes.

419
00:34:03,289 --> 00:34:05,780
- What are the odds?
- Where's the bounce?

420
00:34:13,666 --> 00:34:15,429
Here We go.

421
00:34:23,643 --> 00:34:25,838
There. You getting a little bounce?

422
00:34:26,012 --> 00:34:27,775
A little.

423
00:34:28,715 --> 00:34:30,615
Perfect.

424
00:34:33,886 --> 00:34:35,376
- Are you scared?
- No.

425
00:34:36,256 --> 00:34:38,724
Wait, wait, wait.
Where are you going?

426
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:57,941
- Guess if I have clothes on.
- The guy who lives here is a cop.

427
00:34:58,111 --> 00:35:00,341
- I knoW. I knoW. Guess.
- I knoW the guy.

428
00:35:00,513 --> 00:35:02,378
Guess.

429
00:35:03,116 --> 00:35:04,913
- What is this?
- I don't knoW.

430
00:35:05,084 --> 00:35:08,053
Son of a bitch, this is my harmonica.
That--

431
00:35:08,221 --> 00:35:09,483
What?

432
00:35:12,025 --> 00:35:14,619
Come here. Come here. Hurry.

433
00:35:16,095 --> 00:35:18,290
Christ, I'm late.

434
00:35:20,566 --> 00:35:23,558
Where'd you tear my shirt off last night?

435
00:35:26,272 --> 00:35:29,469
It may be doWnstairs. Check, love.
I'm on duty in 10 minutes.

436
00:35:29,642 --> 00:35:31,371
Yes, officer.

437
00:35:46,993 --> 00:35:50,053
- Take that shirt off. Let's go.
- No Way. I earned it.

438
00:35:50,229 --> 00:35:51,992
- Take it off.
- No.

439
00:35:52,899 --> 00:35:55,231
- Come on.
- "Yes, officer."

440
00:35:55,401 --> 00:35:57,266
- Not funny.
- Yes, it is.

441
00:35:57,437 --> 00:35:59,871
Did you see that tattoo?

442
00:36:00,707 --> 00:36:02,766
Mercy.

443
00:36:20,593 --> 00:36:23,061
- Aloha, Jack.
- Hey, Number 9.

444
00:36:23,229 --> 00:36:26,892
- I have to use your bathroom.
- I'm surprised you didn't use the cop's.

445
00:36:27,066 --> 00:36:28,693
What if he'd seen us?

446
00:36:28,868 --> 00:36:31,359
He would have seen his career
and reputation go.

447
00:36:31,537 --> 00:36:34,335
Let me tell you.
He probably Would've had to kill us.

448
00:36:34,507 --> 00:36:37,704
There's a fine line between taking a risk
and being an idiot.

449
00:36:37,877 --> 00:36:40,846
Maybe he's fine being gay.
Not everyone's in the closet.

450
00:36:41,013 --> 00:36:43,140
What does that mean?

451
00:36:45,418 --> 00:36:47,648
Hurry.

452
00:36:55,728 --> 00:36:57,662
- What a freak-hole.
- What?

453
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:59,798
Jack, it's really depressing here.

454
00:36:59,966 --> 00:37:02,833
- I'm depressed.
- This isn't depressing.

455
00:37:03,903 --> 00:37:07,361
It's one of the things I like about it,
is hoW depressing it is.

456
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,405
It's like Where dreams go to die.

457
00:37:12,478 --> 00:37:15,743
You got me here.
Is there something you Want to shoW me?

458
00:37:16,249 --> 00:37:19,685
- Yeah.
- What?

459
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,025
- Come on.
- I'm spoken for.

460
00:37:29,195 --> 00:37:30,992
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

461
00:37:31,697 --> 00:37:34,860
- Let's go peek in WindoWs. It'll be fun.
- Have a heart.

462
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,973
Does the party ever stop here?

463
00:37:44,644 --> 00:37:48,580
How do you handle all the excitement,
one would wonder.

464
00:37:48,848 --> 00:37:51,009
Lock it up. That's my boss.

465
00:37:51,184 --> 00:37:53,414
What do We have here?

466
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:08,266
Walter is into some kinky shit.
Look at this.

467
00:38:08,434 --> 00:38:10,994
He's a good guy.
He's just watching a dance show.

468
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:15,402
If he's such a good guy,
don't you feel a little bad scamming him?

469
00:38:16,309 --> 00:38:19,870
I'm not scamming him.
Look at me, I'm not scamming him.

470
00:38:20,046 --> 00:38:22,708
You're Working here
like some straight-job front...

471
00:38:22,882 --> 00:38:25,112
...While We're planning a heist on Ray.

472
00:38:25,651 --> 00:38:29,451
It doesn't mean I don't take pride
in my job.

473
00:38:29,922 --> 00:38:33,153
- Should have seen me out there raking.
- Oh, shit.

474
00:38:37,196 --> 00:38:38,561
Hey, man.

475
00:38:38,731 --> 00:38:40,494
- Jack.
- Hey.

476
00:38:40,666 --> 00:38:42,657
- Was that you giggling?
- No.

477
00:38:42,835 --> 00:38:45,235
Must have been Number 9.

478
00:38:45,638 --> 00:38:47,902
What are you doing
sneaking around here?

479
00:38:48,074 --> 00:38:50,770
I'm not sneaking around.
No, I Was just thinking.

480
00:38:50,943 --> 00:38:53,969
Sometimes when I'm thinking,
it looks like I'm sneaking.

481
00:38:55,114 --> 00:38:57,981
- So, what are you thinking about?
- Oh, you know...

482
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:01,745
- I don't Want to bug you.
- Jack...

483
00:39:02,154 --> 00:39:03,985
...you gotta have a little faith.

484
00:39:04,223 --> 00:39:05,485
What, like in God?

485
00:39:06,292 --> 00:39:09,386
Well, God's an imaginary friend
for grownups.

486
00:39:09,562 --> 00:39:12,463
Trick is to knoW Who to have faith in.

487
00:39:12,632 --> 00:39:14,998
I'm gonna give you a hint.

488
00:39:15,701 --> 00:39:19,137
Sometimes things are exactly
as they appear.

489
00:39:19,939 --> 00:39:21,702
Sometimes.

490
00:39:28,548 --> 00:39:31,016
What the heck does that mean?

491
00:40:07,019 --> 00:40:08,384
Get out.

492
00:40:08,988 --> 00:40:10,580
I got something for you.

493
00:40:10,823 --> 00:40:13,690
Mr. Ritchie's private police come by
about this time.

494
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:16,419
Damn, I don't blame them.

495
00:40:16,596 --> 00:40:18,063
Tell me What you Want.

496
00:40:18,731 --> 00:40:22,394
I got these wallets that I'm gonna sell you
for 1500 bucks.

497
00:40:22,868 --> 00:40:25,393
The wallets came from a house
that was robbed.

498
00:40:25,571 --> 00:40:28,369
- I take them to the police--
- Take them to the police.

499
00:40:28,541 --> 00:40:31,237
- They'll appreciate help.
- I could leave the case...

500
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:35,278
...someplace where the police will find it
with Jack's name written on it.

501
00:40:35,448 --> 00:40:38,611
I'm serious, his private police
Will be here any minute.

502
00:40:39,518 --> 00:40:42,180
I've been Waiting for hours.
No police have come.

503
00:40:42,955 --> 00:40:45,048
So come on, get out.

504
00:40:45,591 --> 00:40:47,525
Okay? So we can talk?

505
00:41:17,223 --> 00:41:19,123
Just a second.

506
00:41:20,793 --> 00:41:22,954
- Hi.
- Want me to look at the shoWerhead?

507
00:41:23,129 --> 00:41:27,122
- Yeah. Sorry, I was just taking a nap.
- Enjoying your stay?

508
00:41:27,299 --> 00:41:29,062
I love it. I love it.

509
00:41:41,947 --> 00:41:43,847
Impressive.

510
00:41:51,924 --> 00:41:53,949
Yeah. Good job.

511
00:41:56,629 --> 00:41:59,530
All right, if you need anything,
just give me a holler.

512
00:42:01,934 --> 00:42:03,663
Think about it.

513
00:42:35,167 --> 00:42:36,930
Nice Work.

514
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:39,394
Here.

515
00:42:40,706 --> 00:42:43,504
Ray will bring the money here Thursday.

516
00:42:46,846 --> 00:42:49,713
All we have to do is distract Bob Jr.

517
00:42:50,015 --> 00:42:51,812
And cut the phone lines.

518
00:42:54,253 --> 00:42:56,881
Which shouldn't be too hard to do.

519
00:42:57,089 --> 00:42:59,182
Very masculine feel.

520
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:03,351
What's with the dead moose head
on the wall and the lndian blankets?

521
00:43:04,029 --> 00:43:06,896
- It's a hunting lodge.
- Aloha, it's Hawaii.

522
00:43:07,066 --> 00:43:09,364
Put a lei on its horns or something.

523
00:43:09,902 --> 00:43:13,394
Borrow some Hawaiian shit
from Walter's place.

524
00:43:15,274 --> 00:43:17,742
So you got a plan?

525
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:24,543
- How you doing, Bob?
- What the hell are you doing here?

526
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:31,718
- Bob. Easy, Bob.
- A baseball bat? A tree branch?

527
00:43:31,891 --> 00:43:33,620
I got a tire iron in the truck.

528
00:43:36,562 --> 00:43:39,531
- What'd you do that for?
- You said you had a tire iron.

529
00:43:39,698 --> 00:43:42,531
You bastard! Come here.

530
00:43:46,238 --> 00:43:47,899
Come here.

531
00:44:03,088 --> 00:44:04,953
Brutal.

532
00:44:11,063 --> 00:44:14,430
Doesn't Work doing that.
You got to put your head forWard.

533
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,862
Bullshit.

534
00:44:16,035 --> 00:44:19,198
Put your head forward
and blow your nose and pinch it.

535
00:44:20,039 --> 00:44:22,098
Go on, blow.

536
00:44:29,248 --> 00:44:31,546
That's a lot of blood.

537
00:44:32,184 --> 00:44:34,152
My wife can get the blood out.

538
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:37,448
Just have her use cold Water.
That'll do it.

539
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:40,756
She'll know what to do.

540
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,060
You all right?

541
00:44:52,972 --> 00:44:54,769
You sure shoWed him.

542
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:57,534
Too bad he's not a girl.

543
00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:00,304
- Shut the hell up.
- That's okay.

544
00:45:00,479 --> 00:45:02,845
- It's the thought that counts.
- Count me out.

545
00:45:03,015 --> 00:45:05,506
I don't care how much money
is in the lodge.

546
00:45:05,684 --> 00:45:08,983
I didn't know how or when you'd say that,
but I knew you would.

547
00:45:09,154 --> 00:45:12,317
Police will ask Bob Jr.
if anything strange happened.

548
00:45:12,491 --> 00:45:14,721
- He'll mention this.
- Ray's gonna report...

549
00:45:14,894 --> 00:45:19,354
...his leg-breaking payoff money
was stolen? I'm sure.

550
00:45:20,366 --> 00:45:22,197
Come on, let's talk about it...

551
00:45:22,368 --> 00:45:25,269
...after I've cleaned you up. Okay?

552
00:45:25,571 --> 00:45:27,198
Come on.

553
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,570
Come on. You were wonderful.

554
00:45:41,487 --> 00:45:44,149
- There's no beer in the fridge.
- ln the cabinet.

555
00:45:44,323 --> 00:45:46,985
In the cabinet? What are you, British?

556
00:45:54,867 --> 00:45:57,700
Oh, boy.

557
00:46:03,309 --> 00:46:05,869
No beer. Just a bunch of Wallets.

558
00:46:06,045 --> 00:46:07,535
Recognize them?

559
00:46:07,713 --> 00:46:10,614
What's the name of the little game
you're playing?

560
00:46:10,783 --> 00:46:14,879
Gee, if I didn't know better, Jack,
I'd think you were a moody guy.

561
00:46:15,788 --> 00:46:18,552
Well, I'll see you later on. Take care.

562
00:46:18,724 --> 00:46:21,591
Frank-something came here last night.

563
00:46:21,794 --> 00:46:25,195
If I didn't give him 1500 for the Wallets,
he'd go to the cops.

564
00:46:25,364 --> 00:46:27,525
- He settled for 450.
- You got robbed.

565
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:30,533
He'd have settled for 100.
Why did he think you'd care?

566
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:33,295
He must figure
We have something going.

567
00:46:33,472 --> 00:46:36,635
- He could see the chemistry.
- I guess.

568
00:46:36,809 --> 00:46:39,539
Jack, we cannot afford
a loose cannon here.

569
00:46:39,712 --> 00:46:42,203
From Where I'm sitting,
you're the loose cannon.

570
00:46:42,381 --> 00:46:44,747
And as far as Frank goes,
that's his story.

571
00:46:45,818 --> 00:46:52,053
- Jack, I need you.
- I knoW. Let me think about it.

572
00:46:52,224 --> 00:46:55,125
Okay, I've thought about it.
No, I'm gonna pass.

573
00:46:55,294 --> 00:46:57,159
I'm gonna take these With me.

574
00:46:57,329 --> 00:46:59,388
Jackie.

575
00:47:08,607 --> 00:47:12,771
Oh, come on. That's insulting.
Do you think I'm that easy?

576
00:47:14,279 --> 00:47:17,806
- Maybe I am that easy.
- You are that easy.

577
00:47:22,554 --> 00:47:25,682
- Wait, Wait.
- It's probably my mom.

578
00:47:25,858 --> 00:47:27,883
Hold that thought.

579
00:47:29,495 --> 00:47:31,793
Is your mother hot?

580
00:47:32,765 --> 00:47:35,563
What? I want to know
if you look like mother-daughter.

581
00:47:35,734 --> 00:47:37,099
- Easy, Jack.
- Jeez.

582
00:47:46,512 --> 00:47:48,412
Hi, gorgeous.

583
00:47:53,652 --> 00:47:55,813
I got 20 minutes, tops.

584
00:47:55,988 --> 00:47:57,455
Ticktock.

585
00:47:57,623 --> 00:48:00,854
- Where's Mrs. B.J.?
- She's at the beauty parlor.

586
00:48:01,026 --> 00:48:03,085
Getting her hair enlarged?

587
00:48:03,262 --> 00:48:05,787
- You taking a shoWer?
- No.

588
00:48:06,432 --> 00:48:08,229
I'm just glad to see you.

589
00:48:09,735 --> 00:48:11,498
I Was about to.

590
00:48:12,237 --> 00:48:15,673
- Maybe you could use some company.
- No.

591
00:48:15,841 --> 00:48:18,002
I like you un-fresh.

592
00:48:18,544 --> 00:48:21,206
That little bastard sucker punched me.

593
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:24,907
- No, you kicked his ass.
- You think?

594
00:48:26,085 --> 00:48:28,076
I'm gonna turn the shoWer off.

595
00:48:28,253 --> 00:48:30,016
- You wait right here.
- Okay.

596
00:48:48,403 --> 00:48:49,836
Who Was it doWn there?

597
00:48:50,371 --> 00:48:52,896
The neighborhood Watch,
probably looking for you.

598
00:48:53,074 --> 00:48:54,871
You stay in this bed...

599
00:48:55,043 --> 00:48:59,241
...and we will get honest to God
dirty serious about finishing this.

600

- I'll be back.

603
00:49:08,323 --> 00:49:09,950
Stop.

605
00:49:23,805 --> 00:49:26,968

- That's got to be Ray.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

610
00:49:39,087 --> 00:49:41,715

613
00:49:52,634 --> 00:49:55,467
- You're gonna hate me.
- No, I'm not.

614
00:49:57,305 --> 00:49:59,603
What? What are you doing?

615
00:49:59,774 --> 00:50:03,574
Yeah. Just have your way with me.

616
00:50:13,154 --> 00:50:16,453

617
00:50:21,663 --> 00:50:25,030
- Come on.
- I told you I'd be quick.

618
00:50:25,199 --> 00:50:26,496
What did Ray Want?

619
00:50:26,668 --> 00:50:29,831
He wanted to make sure
that I don't get bored.

620
00:50:32,573 --> 00:50:34,302
Time's up.

621
00:50:34,475 --> 00:50:37,273
- lt is not.
- You're not alloWing for drive time.

622
00:50:37,445 --> 00:50:39,709
You better cut it out. Teasing's not fair.

623
00:50:39,881 --> 00:50:43,146
Nobody's teasing, Bob. Get your shoes.

624
00:50:45,253 --> 00:50:47,847
I don't want you to get in trouble
with the wifey.

625
00:50:48,022 --> 00:50:51,822
Taste the goods now, it might spoil
your appetite for the date Thursday.

626
00:50:51,993 --> 00:50:53,790
But I'm starving right noW.

627
00:50:53,962 --> 00:50:57,022
You better hurry before
Whatever-her-name-is gets pissed.

628
00:50:57,198 --> 00:50:59,860
See you at the lodge Thursday.

629
00:51:00,101 --> 00:51:02,001
- Thursday!
- Fuck Thursday!

630
00:51:12,714 --> 00:51:17,549
At 6:00, Bob Jr. will be waiting
in the hunting lodge for you.

631
00:51:17,719 --> 00:51:20,950
Take one shot and bloW out a WindoW.

632
00:51:21,756 --> 00:51:25,385
Bob Jr.'s kind of a coWboy.
He'll go out, see What's going on.

633
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:28,791
I'll go in the back and grab the money.

634
00:51:29,597 --> 00:51:32,498
But What if he comes back in?

635
00:51:33,601 --> 00:51:35,899
BloW out another WindoW.

636
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:39,767
I'll cut the telephone lines,
puncture his tires.

637
00:51:39,941 --> 00:51:45,038
That should give me time to get back
and join Walter for the domino game.

638
00:51:55,523 --> 00:51:57,514
Okay.

639
00:51:57,825 --> 00:51:59,087
Go to sleep.

640
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:02,128
- Good night.
- Good night.

641
00:52:24,252 --> 00:52:28,484
So you're sure about
your domino-game cover?

642
00:52:28,656 --> 00:52:30,817
You're sure?

643
00:52:30,992 --> 00:52:32,926
Yeah.

644
00:52:38,499 --> 00:52:41,024
- Hello.
- Did you steal my cell phone?

645
00:52:41,202 --> 00:52:42,601
Yes.

646
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:45,204
Do you know if a guy named Victor
called me?

647
00:52:45,373 --> 00:52:47,170
- Yes, he did.
- What did he say?

648
00:52:47,341 --> 00:52:48,603
He Wanted to apologize.

649
00:52:48,776 --> 00:52:52,041
He said stuff in the heat of the moment
he Wished he hadn't...

650
00:52:52,213 --> 00:52:54,374
...and hoped that you may forgive him.

651
00:52:54,549 --> 00:52:55,811
- He did?
- Yeah.

652
00:52:55,983 --> 00:52:58,383
That's so sweet.
Think I should call him?

653
00:52:58,553 --> 00:53:02,819
- You have his number?
- Of course I do. Thank you.

654
00:53:04,492 --> 00:53:08,451
- He didn't really call, did he?
- Yeah, he did.

655
00:53:08,629 --> 00:53:10,529
Of course he did.

656
00:53:10,898 --> 00:53:14,197
- Just make that up?
- Jack, last night!

657
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:18,764
I thought you Were Walking funny.

658
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:22,808
- I was just gonna ask you that.
- Wasn't sure if that was my imagination.

659
00:53:23,544 --> 00:53:28,277
Tell me What first attracted you to me.

660
00:53:28,449 --> 00:53:30,440
- Come on, that's corny.
- No, it's not.

661
00:53:30,618 --> 00:53:33,246
I Want to knoW.
It means a lot to me.

662
00:53:33,421 --> 00:53:36,481
You Want the truth or the bullshit?

663
00:53:37,191 --> 00:53:38,818
Either.

664
00:53:39,494 --> 00:53:43,396
You're really easy on the eyes,
but it was really more than that.

665
00:53:43,564 --> 00:53:48,433
It was more a sort of strength of character
that you had in your face.

666
00:53:48,603 --> 00:53:52,539
This kind of generosity of spirit.

667
00:53:52,707 --> 00:53:55,938
For all your kind of strutting around
and acting tough...

668
00:53:56,110 --> 00:54:00,308
...you remind me of a little kid sometimes,
and I thought that was funny.

669
00:54:00,481 --> 00:54:03,041
Okay. Now the truth.

670
00:54:04,752 --> 00:54:08,688
If that girl's not careful, she'll wind up
on the business end of my di--

671
00:54:08,856 --> 00:54:13,020
Oh, my God! Shut up.

672
00:54:16,497 --> 00:54:18,522
See you later.

673
00:54:51,199 --> 00:54:52,757
Jack.

674
00:54:53,568 --> 00:54:55,593
- What's up?
- As soon as you can...

675
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:58,432
...go into town and get some paint
for Number 9.

676
00:54:58,706 --> 00:55:00,571
- Take the Xterra.
- Number 9?

677
00:55:00,741 --> 00:55:05,542
What is it With you and Number 9?
I'm thinking you got something going on.

678
00:55:06,047 --> 00:55:10,643
Well, I thought so,
but she's a devout Catholic.

679
00:55:10,818 --> 00:55:12,479
Oh, bless her heart.

680
00:55:12,653 --> 00:55:16,521
- Are we still on for dominoes tomorrow?
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Bring cash.

681
00:55:16,691 --> 00:55:20,752
- Those guys Will kick your ass.
- Noted.

682
00:55:26,734 --> 00:55:28,463
Not me.

683
00:55:29,237 --> 00:55:32,502
Funny how sounds get carried in wind.
Guess it's wind chimes.

684
00:55:32,673 --> 00:55:34,300
I'm super excited to play.

685
00:55:34,475 --> 00:55:37,444
And it's payable immediately.
No tears.

686
00:55:37,645 --> 00:55:39,340
Don't forget the paint.

687
00:56:16,817 --> 00:56:18,717
Hey, Mrs. Ritchie.

688
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:21,113
Be careful.

689
00:56:30,531 --> 00:56:33,557
Okay. There you go.

690
00:56:33,734 --> 00:56:35,964
Give me the glasses.

691
00:56:36,704 --> 00:56:39,764
- Flight okay, Mr. Ritchie?
- The usual. HoW's the bitch?

692
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:42,602
- Which bitch?
- Nancy.

693
00:56:42,777 --> 00:56:45,337
She's been hanging around
with that Jack asshole.

694
00:56:45,513 --> 00:56:48,209
He's here? I told you to run his ass
off the island.

695
00:56:49,216 --> 00:56:51,980
I give you a simple damn order,
and you blow it.

696
00:56:52,153 --> 00:56:56,487
Shouldn't have hired a local parasite.
Look, have Lou Harris take care of him.

697
00:56:56,657 --> 00:56:59,148
- Think you can handle that?
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

698
00:56:59,327 --> 00:57:01,887
- You useless?
- Of course not.

699
00:57:02,663 --> 00:57:05,029
I got it.
Put my garment bag on top.

700
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:07,861
- I did, Mrs. Ritchie.
- Good thing.

701
00:57:09,937 --> 00:57:11,234
I got it.

702
00:57:15,276 --> 00:57:17,744
Come on, Ray, ndale.

703
00:57:53,814 --> 00:57:55,907
Hey, wow, you do your marketing here.

704
00:57:56,083 --> 00:57:58,074
Yeah.

705
00:57:58,486 --> 00:58:03,719
- It's no fun Without you, Jackie.
- What is it about the produce section?

706
00:58:04,225 --> 00:58:05,487
Why are you grabbing-- ?

707
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:09,088
- What happened?
- God, Ritchie's wife walked in.

708
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:17,599
Not my biggest fan. I cannot let her see me.
She could set Ray off and ruin everything.

709
00:58:17,772 --> 00:58:21,868
- Stock boy to aisle three. Broken glass.
- Oh, my God.

710
00:58:22,042 --> 00:58:24,738
I thought if she's in residence,
that means...

711
00:58:24,912 --> 00:58:28,177
- Aren't you banished to the hunting lodge?
- Yeah.

712
00:58:28,349 --> 00:58:31,546
Okay, that's it.
The plan just crashed and burned.

713
00:58:34,054 --> 00:58:35,749
Do not give up on this. Okay?

714
00:58:35,923 --> 00:58:38,187
Let me just think this through.

715
00:58:38,359 --> 00:58:41,385
We can both still get what we want.
Okay?

716
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:44,427
Now you go.

717
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,161
There he is, Frank.

718
00:58:49,170 --> 00:58:51,297
- Hey, Batman.
- Yes?

719
00:58:51,472 --> 00:58:55,101
- Still hanging around looking for trouble?
- No. No bat today.

720
00:58:56,043 --> 00:58:57,305
I'll tell you What.

721
00:58:57,478 --> 00:58:59,912
Next time we meet,
you'll wish you were born...

722
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:02,139
...with eyes in the back of your head.

723
00:59:02,316 --> 00:59:05,683
HoW does that turtleneck thing Work?
Does it keep your head on?

724
00:59:05,853 --> 00:59:07,150
Funny guy.

725
00:59:08,789 --> 00:59:12,850
We're gonna have a "come to Jesus"
talk soon. Very soon.

726
00:59:14,895 --> 00:59:17,489
- Come on, guys.
- Jack.

727
00:59:18,165 --> 00:59:21,100
- NeW best friend?
- I oWe the guy a lot of money, okay?

728
00:59:21,268 --> 00:59:23,566
I just can't bloW him off.

729
00:59:23,737 --> 00:59:26,900
- No, you couldn't do that.
- Jack, come on.

730
00:59:27,074 --> 00:59:31,238
Frank, Why didn't you put the beer case
behind Kammie's Market like We agreed?

731
00:59:31,412 --> 00:59:35,212
You know I have serious money problems.
That's why I hit up your girl.

732
00:59:35,382 --> 00:59:39,341
Don't mess this up for me.
I'm into something good. Come on, Frank.

733
00:59:40,287 --> 00:59:43,381
- What am I supposed to do?
- Have a little faith in people.

734
00:59:43,624 --> 00:59:46,855
Not God because he's just
an imaginary friend for grownups.

735
00:59:47,027 --> 00:59:49,359
- What the hell does that mean?
- I don't knoW.

736
00:59:49,530 --> 00:59:51,998
Come on.
You're up to something, and I know it.

737
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,963
I Was into something. It just fell apart.
That's the truth.

738
00:59:56,136 --> 00:59:59,264
And that's good because I don't need
any more court dates.

739
01:00:01,141 --> 01:00:04,941
That's the truth.
That's a good-looking shirt, by the Way.

740
01:00:07,381 --> 01:00:10,282
- Give me 10.
- This is nothing like mahjong.

741
01:00:10,451 --> 01:00:12,442
- You play mahjong?
- No.

742
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:15,680
- Hello.
- Walter, put our boy on the phone.

743
01:00:15,856 --> 01:00:17,551
It's for you.

744
01:00:17,992 --> 01:00:20,426
- Hello.
- I know you can 't talk right now.

745
01:00:20,594 --> 01:00:22,653
- Here's what I found out.
- No, I'm fine.

746
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:26,129
- It's good to hear your voice.
- Bob Jr. has strict orders...

747
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:29,792
...to take me to the hunting lodge.
The money's at the beach house.

748
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:33,098
- We can't do it then.
- I'll keep Bob Jr. at the lodge.

749
01:00:33,274 --> 01:00:37,540
You know the layout. The money
will be in the office safe. We are so close.

750
01:00:37,711 --> 01:00:40,942
- Where's Ritchie?
- He'll be out of the house at 5:30.

751
01:00:41,115 --> 01:00:44,607
You can break into the house
with only that helpless drunk in it.

752
01:00:44,785 --> 01:00:48,243
- I think I'm gonna pass.
- TWo hundred thousand dollars.

753
01:00:48,656 --> 01:00:50,988
- Not enough.
- The key for the sliding door...

754
01:00:51,158 --> 01:00:53,285
...and combination
will be under the mat.

755
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:56,020
All you do is walk in poor
and walk out rich.

756
01:00:56,196 --> 01:00:59,324
What will happen if that money
reaches those thugs?

757
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:02,799
- They'll probably have a hell of a luau.
- I mean to Walter.

758
01:01:02,970 --> 01:01:07,066
- He'll probably get invited.
- Jack, just tell me you'll think about it.

759
01:01:07,241 --> 01:01:09,766
All right, I'll bring the poi.

760
01:01:09,944 --> 01:01:12,936
- lf not for us, do it for Walter.
- What?

761
01:01:13,113 --> 01:01:16,947
Because sooner or later,
Ray Will bulldoze Keiki Vista under the sand.

762
01:01:17,117 --> 01:01:19,051
All right. Take care.

763
01:01:21,789 --> 01:01:23,689
Wrong number.

764
01:01:25,993 --> 01:01:28,689
Nancy burying a pig?

765
01:01:30,831 --> 01:01:32,423
Getting in deep, aren't you?

766
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,861
I don't knoW about this girl.

767
01:01:35,035 --> 01:01:38,129
A part of me thinks
she could be the answer.

768
01:01:38,305 --> 01:01:42,969
Then a part of me thinks you're gonna
open up the paper one day, and it will be:

769
01:01:43,143 --> 01:01:48,240
"The partially nude body of yours truly
was found floating in Waimea Bay.

770
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:50,713
Nancy Hayes sought for questioning."

771
01:01:50,884 --> 01:01:54,911
I've been expecting to read headlines
like that about Nancy since she Was 15.

772
01:01:55,089 --> 01:01:58,684
- She's not dull.
- No, nobody's ever said that about her.

773
01:01:58,859 --> 01:02:02,659
But I'm warning you, Jack,
you're sticking your neck way out.

774
01:02:02,830 --> 01:02:04,889
No, I'm fine.

775
01:02:05,065 --> 01:02:07,192
She just has a little mischief in her...

776
01:02:07,368 --> 01:02:10,394
...that makes it kind of fun to be around.

777
01:02:10,571 --> 01:02:15,008
The other day, she took off her clothes
and then folded them in neat little piles.

778
01:02:15,175 --> 01:02:18,235
- lt Was--
- You really are smitten.

779
01:02:19,446 --> 01:02:23,280
Sometimes you get so alone,
it just makes sense.

780
01:02:24,118 --> 01:02:26,916
- Does that make sense?
- Hell, no.

781
01:02:28,122 --> 01:02:32,491
If you think you're gonna control this girl
or control yourself with her...

782
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:36,027
...you've got a mind-breaking realization
coming, son.

783
01:02:36,330 --> 01:02:38,195
She's nothing but trouble.

784
01:02:38,365 --> 01:02:42,028
The problem is a lot of stuff you say
makes me Want to be around her.

785
01:02:42,403 --> 01:02:44,132
Okay.

786
01:02:44,304 --> 01:02:46,932
Well, I'm through talking about her.

787
01:02:48,308 --> 01:02:52,005
So where does Ritchie stow her
now that the bride is back?

788
01:02:52,212 --> 01:02:55,511
- They all sleep in the same bed?
- ls Mrs. Ritchie back?

789
01:02:55,916 --> 01:02:58,441
Well, he doesn't let her get very far.

790
01:02:58,619 --> 01:03:02,783
- All of his assets are in her name.
- Shit, why doesn't she divorce him...

791
01:03:02,956 --> 01:03:05,117
...and take it all?

792
01:03:05,793 --> 01:03:09,923
I think they got some sort of
prenuptial agreement in place.

793
01:03:10,097 --> 01:03:12,725
Or so I hear.

794
01:03:16,103 --> 01:03:18,628
- Want to try again?
- Fire it up.

795
01:03:27,948 --> 01:03:34,046
- What are you looking at?
- I'm putting my key under the mat.

796
01:03:34,722 --> 01:03:36,451
Remember?

797
01:03:37,458 --> 01:03:40,188
You Weren't at the supermarket.

798
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:42,624
- Thought you chickened out.
- Jack shoWed up.

799
01:03:42,796 --> 01:03:45,822
I had to get him out
before he saW us together.

800
01:03:46,867 --> 01:03:50,462
Tell me that's number one, Alison.

801
01:03:51,071 --> 01:03:53,266
I can't do it.

802
01:03:53,741 --> 01:03:56,938
Ray's acting all weird.
I think he knows something.

803
01:03:57,377 --> 01:03:59,208
What time Will Jack shoW up here?

804
01:03:59,379 --> 01:04:02,348
He will walk through that door
at 6:00 sharp.

805
01:04:02,516 --> 01:04:05,815
I Will make sure that Bob Jr.
is noWhere to be found.

806
01:04:05,986 --> 01:04:10,184
From noW on, Alison, it's your shoW.

807
01:04:10,357 --> 01:04:12,348
My shoW.

808
01:04:14,762 --> 01:04:17,925
And, sweetie, lay off the booze.

809
01:04:25,773 --> 01:04:28,708
And stay off my boat!

810
01:04:47,261 --> 01:04:50,458
- Hey!
- You hold it right there. Hold it!

811
01:04:50,931 --> 01:04:53,957
You, get out of the car! This way!
Stand there.

812
01:04:54,134 --> 01:04:55,761
- Come on.
- Whoa.

813
01:04:55,936 --> 01:04:57,426
- You "whoa"!
- All right.

814
01:04:57,604 --> 01:04:59,128
- Get down.
- Look, Harris.

815
01:04:59,306 --> 01:05:02,332
Being stupid doesn't mean you Want to die.
My name is--

816
01:05:02,509 --> 01:05:04,204
- Shut up!
- Don't do that, Harris.

817
01:05:04,378 --> 01:05:07,643
You've caused enough bollocks.
You Want to piss With me?

818
01:05:07,815 --> 01:05:10,875
I don't understand what you're saying.
Want to piss with you?

819
01:05:11,051 --> 01:05:13,542
- Walter, don't. It might go off.
- All right.

820
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:21,927
I tried to Warn him.

821
01:05:49,590 --> 01:05:52,753
So, anyway, this skeleton walks
into a bar.

822
01:05:52,926 --> 01:05:57,522
Skeleton goes to the bartender and says,
"Give me a pitcher of beer...

823
01:05:57,698 --> 01:05:59,996
...and a mop."

824
01:06:02,102 --> 01:06:04,127
We're gonna play $100 cutthroat.

825
01:06:04,304 --> 01:06:05,931
Do you know how to play that?

826
01:06:06,106 --> 01:06:10,668
This is--
NoW I've got five, for chrissake.

827
01:06:12,012 --> 01:06:15,948
- lt gets less each time you shuffle.
- You're supposed to take seven out.

828
01:06:16,116 --> 01:06:19,449
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
Shouldn't quit on five.

829
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:22,817
- That's a sign of weakness.
- What have you guys-- ? Got eight?

830
01:06:22,990 --> 01:06:24,753
No, I have seven.

831
01:06:24,925 --> 01:06:27,223
So, anyway, Jack steps up.

832
01:06:27,394 --> 01:06:29,157
- "Cheap Shot" Jack.
- My specialty.

833
01:06:29,329 --> 01:06:31,797
He gives him a straight left
to that broke jaw.

834
01:06:31,965 --> 01:06:34,900
Man, that guy dropped like a brick!

835
01:06:35,102 --> 01:06:38,162
That is the best late excuse
you've ever come up With.

836
01:06:38,338 --> 01:06:41,933
I'm telling you the truth.
Am I lying, Jack?

837
01:06:47,214 --> 01:06:48,909
Sorry I'm late.

838
01:06:50,617 --> 01:06:52,608
You kept me Waiting.

839
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:56,219
I'm sure we can work out
a proper punishment.

840
01:06:56,390 --> 01:06:59,951
The thing is, Nancy, I can't stay.

841
01:07:00,594 --> 01:07:04,860
- What do you mean?
- I mean I can't go through With this...

842
01:07:05,032 --> 01:07:07,398
...assignation.

843
01:07:08,535 --> 01:07:10,662
What's going on, Junior?

844
01:07:12,105 --> 01:07:15,006
- Ariana's in the car.
- Your wife?

845
01:07:15,175 --> 01:07:18,303
- What is your wife doing in the car?
- Don't get mad, Nancy.

846
01:07:18,478 --> 01:07:22,642
I'm not mad. I'm just confused.

847
01:07:22,950 --> 01:07:26,215
- Talk.
- She knows about us.

848
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:29,983
- KnoWs What?
- I told her.

849
01:07:30,157 --> 01:07:31,852
There's nothing to tell.

850
01:07:32,025 --> 01:07:35,654
The other day, she said
that I smelled different.

851
01:07:35,829 --> 01:07:40,129
- "I've been to a strip club, Ariana."
- I gotta get out of here.

852
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:42,825
You can't just leave me here...

853
01:07:43,003 --> 01:07:44,368
...Iike this.

854
01:07:48,041 --> 01:07:49,668
Ariana?

855
01:07:50,043 --> 01:07:52,637
It's our oWn private honk.

856
01:07:54,214 --> 01:07:56,808
I'm sorry. I've said everything
I came to say.

857
01:07:59,186 --> 01:08:03,816
Maybe we should invite your wife
in here to join us.

858
01:08:03,991 --> 01:08:07,859
You knoW, just the three of us.
You knoW.

859
01:08:08,028 --> 01:08:11,896
That's a really bad idea.

860
01:08:12,866 --> 01:08:15,733
You had a rough start,
and you're trying to find your--

861
01:08:15,902 --> 01:08:18,928
You don't know anything
about who I am, Bob.

862
01:08:19,473 --> 01:08:20,906
Okay.

863
01:08:21,508 --> 01:08:25,535
Look, I'm just a whim to you,
a way of getting back at Ray.

864
01:08:25,712 --> 01:08:28,010
Hell, I'm guilty of those same Whims.

865
01:08:28,181 --> 01:08:31,548
I mean, you are a knockout,
in a slutty kind of way.

866
01:08:32,619 --> 01:08:36,919
There's got to be a loaded gun
around here someplace.

867
01:09:16,730 --> 01:09:19,722
- All right, let's cut the crap. Who's first?
- Me. Five.

868
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:21,765
You might have set something up.

869
01:09:21,935 --> 01:09:24,130
- Give me 15.
- Good play.

870
01:09:24,304 --> 01:09:26,499
- Wait a minute. I got a four.
- Goddamn it.

871
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:29,808
- You can't do that.
- HoW much is that?

872
01:09:29,976 --> 01:09:33,503
- You'd think I'd never played this game.
- Fours, deuces or fives.

873
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:37,446
- Searching for a pulse, Walter?
- Did I set my pipe down somewhere?

874
01:09:37,851 --> 01:09:41,150
Is this another one of your strategic
diversionary tactics?

875
01:09:41,321 --> 01:09:44,313
- No, I knoW I grabbed it. I picked it up.
- I'll get it.

876
01:09:44,491 --> 01:09:46,652
- You don't have to do that.
- I'll get it.

877
01:09:46,827 --> 01:09:50,285
I don't want you to have any excuses
when you lose this game.

878
01:09:50,464 --> 01:09:52,125
He's interrupting the floW.

879
01:09:52,299 --> 01:09:54,767
No, you're interrupting. Let's play.

880
01:09:54,935 --> 01:09:57,995
He reminds me of you, Joe.

881
01:09:58,972 --> 01:10:00,701
- Thanks, Jack.
- I love you, Joe.

882
01:10:01,308 --> 01:10:03,469
Somebody play. I'm getting old.

883
01:10:03,877 --> 01:10:05,936
That kid's a sWeetheart.

884
01:10:33,807 --> 01:10:37,743
Umbrella drinks on me, mahalo.

885
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:42,505
NoW he gets interesting.

886
01:10:57,364 --> 01:10:58,831
Bang!

887
01:11:51,785 --> 01:11:53,412
Oh, shit.

888
01:11:53,987 --> 01:11:55,386
Oh, God.

889
01:12:30,390 --> 01:12:32,187
Don't bounce too high.

890
01:12:32,359 --> 01:12:35,419
Praise the Lord, Jackie. You're still alive.

891
01:12:35,595 --> 01:12:37,961
I couldn't do it. I raced back to Warn you.

892
01:12:38,131 --> 01:12:40,065
To Warn me?

893
01:12:41,167 --> 01:12:43,135
You set me up.

894
01:12:44,371 --> 01:12:47,772
I sWear, I couldn't let them kill you.

895
01:12:48,308 --> 01:12:51,903
And look, you have the $200,000
in your hand.

896
01:12:52,379 --> 01:12:54,472
You weren't lying about that.

897
01:12:56,249 --> 01:12:59,377
God, wouldn't it be great
if you were telling the truth?

898
01:12:59,552 --> 01:13:01,747
I Wonder What that Would look like.

899
01:13:02,122 --> 01:13:04,818
It looks like this.

900
01:13:07,661 --> 01:13:09,492
So who did she shoot?

901
01:13:09,663 --> 01:13:12,894
I Was going for the back door,
but my friend beat me to it.

902
01:13:13,066 --> 01:13:14,897
He took a bullet for me.

903
01:13:15,068 --> 01:13:17,263
Bless his heart.

904
01:13:21,041 --> 01:13:23,976
- Shit!
- What?

905
01:13:25,312 --> 01:13:28,042
- What? I shot Jack.
- No.

906
01:13:29,549 --> 01:13:32,575
- Who did I shoot?
- I don't knoW.

907
01:13:32,752 --> 01:13:36,085
Some random.

908
01:13:37,190 --> 01:13:40,387
Well, there goes that plan.

909
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:43,620
HoW did he get in here?
HoW did he knoW Where the key Was?

910
01:13:47,233 --> 01:13:50,691
- I think I forgot to lock the door.
- You Were drinking?

911
01:13:52,238 --> 01:13:55,105
I had a couple of toddies.

912
01:13:56,543 --> 01:13:59,706
- Am I dead, and no one told me?
- No, no.

913
01:13:59,879 --> 01:14:01,540
Oh, honey.

914
01:14:01,881 --> 01:14:03,508
What about that night We had?

915
01:14:03,683 --> 01:14:06,311
- What about it?
- You knoW...

916
01:14:06,486 --> 01:14:09,546
...that there was a real connection there.
You know it.

917
01:14:09,723 --> 01:14:12,920
Yeah, I know. But there are a couple
of bodies downstairs...

918
01:14:13,093 --> 01:14:17,291
...and your brilliant partners
are figuring out a way to pin it on you.

919
01:14:17,897 --> 01:14:20,457
If you're smart,
Which you haven't been so far...

920
01:14:20,633 --> 01:14:25,332
...you'll get off this island real quick.
You better swim for it.

921
01:14:25,772 --> 01:14:29,435
I'm sorry you don't believe me.
You'll never get over me.

922
01:14:29,609 --> 01:14:32,237
Yeah. So long.

923
01:14:40,653 --> 01:14:42,518
He's not breathing.

924
01:14:44,391 --> 01:14:45,790
Can't get a pulse.

925
01:14:45,959 --> 01:14:48,291
Sometimes they put a mirror
under their nose.

926
01:14:48,862 --> 01:14:51,990
- HoW much did you dose him?
- I emptied the bottle.

927
01:14:52,899 --> 01:14:57,165
You could put down a troop train
with a whole bottle, Al.

928
01:14:57,337 --> 01:15:00,829
Honey, the plan Was to kill Jack.

929
01:15:01,007 --> 01:15:03,498
Right? With his record, a perfect patsy.

930
01:15:03,676 --> 01:15:06,577
Then kill an unconscious Ray
with a baseball bat.

931
01:15:06,746 --> 01:15:09,806
Then it looks like Jack broke in,
killed Ray...

932
01:15:09,983 --> 01:15:13,851
...you shot Jack in self-defense.
Don't you remember? We Went over it.

933
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:18,286
- Right. To cover up the robbery.
- No, no, no. Honey, no.

934
01:15:18,458 --> 01:15:22,417
To kill Ray and hush money Nancy.

935
01:15:23,163 --> 01:15:25,893
NoW tWo bodies to dispose of.

936
01:15:26,065 --> 01:15:29,034
- And neither one of them is Jack.
- And that's a big deal.

937
01:15:29,302 --> 01:15:32,362
Yeah. Jack can nail us.

938
01:15:36,876 --> 01:15:38,867
Jesus, lady!

939
01:15:39,846 --> 01:15:42,246
You shot me!

940
01:15:52,258 --> 01:15:55,125
One body just disposed of itself.

941
01:15:55,295 --> 01:15:57,160
I'll be damned.

942
01:15:57,330 --> 01:15:59,798
Oh, Walter, I don't want to be executed.

943
01:15:59,966 --> 01:16:03,333
No need to worry about that, sugar.

944
01:16:03,503 --> 01:16:05,801
HaWaii doesn't have the death penalty.

945
01:16:05,972 --> 01:16:08,964
- Oh, thank God.
- Yeah.

946
01:16:09,742 --> 01:16:13,610
Well, at least Ray is dead.

947
01:16:14,314 --> 01:16:17,977
- Should I whack him with the bat anyway?
- No, no, no. No.

948
01:16:19,219 --> 01:16:22,416
No, We need a neW plan.

949
01:16:22,789 --> 01:16:24,256
NeW patsy.

950
01:16:24,424 --> 01:16:26,221
Ray.

951
01:16:26,826 --> 01:16:28,919
He shot...

952
01:16:29,095 --> 01:16:30,892
...some guy...

953
01:16:31,064 --> 01:16:34,522
- ...and then killed himself.
- With a bat?

954
01:16:36,135 --> 01:16:38,626
Or the other way around.

955
01:16:39,973 --> 01:16:42,305
Don't think, babe.

956
01:16:42,475 --> 01:16:44,409
Bad for the team.

957
01:16:46,246 --> 01:16:49,079
HoW about Nancy?

958
01:16:50,583 --> 01:16:52,448
Genius.

959
01:16:53,019 --> 01:16:55,044
I hate her.

960
01:16:57,757 --> 01:16:59,190
Okay.

961
01:17:02,695 --> 01:17:05,425
I came to Warn you, Jack.

962
01:17:07,734 --> 01:17:09,565
That's Jack?

963
01:17:13,072 --> 01:17:15,404
And there it was. Son of a bitch.

964
01:17:16,242 --> 01:17:19,268
Walter's words running through
my head like a loop.

965
01:17:19,445 --> 01:17:23,609
"Sometimes things
are exactly as they appear. "

966
01:17:23,783 --> 01:17:25,148
It's catchy.

967
01:17:25,318 --> 01:17:27,309
Like an epitaph.

968
01:18:34,721 --> 01:18:36,586
- Hey.
- Hey.

969
01:18:36,756 --> 01:18:39,224
Not much of a good hitching spot.

970
01:18:39,392 --> 01:18:41,553
No, not much.

971
01:18:42,228 --> 01:18:43,661
Maybe it' s that disguise.

972
01:18:44,530 --> 01:18:46,054
You like it?

973
01:18:47,033 --> 01:18:50,161
- Where are you going?
- I'm escaping.

974
01:18:50,403 --> 01:18:53,861
I'd like to know which one of you geniuses
came up with this plan.

975
01:18:55,842 --> 01:19:00,370
It just sort of happened after I caught
Walter and Alison going at it on the boat.

976
01:19:00,546 --> 01:19:03,879
Walter and Alison Were going at it?

977
01:19:04,183 --> 01:19:06,083
- Good Lord.
- So anyway...

978
01:19:06,252 --> 01:19:08,516
...blackmail came immediately to mind.

979
01:19:08,688 --> 01:19:11,555
But Walter figured a way for us
to get what we wanted.

980
01:19:11,891 --> 01:19:14,860
I'll have to be sober if I ever try
to tell this story.

981
01:19:15,028 --> 01:19:18,156
Oh, Jack, come on.
You were scamming me.

982
01:19:18,698 --> 01:19:22,327
Breaking into Ray's,
getting close to me to get next to him.

983
01:19:22,502 --> 01:19:25,801
I mean, What Were you after, anyWay?

984
01:19:25,972 --> 01:19:28,702
I knoW it Wasn't just about me.

985
01:19:31,210 --> 01:19:32,768
Was it?

986
01:19:33,046 --> 01:19:35,674
No. Come on.

987
01:19:35,848 --> 01:19:38,646
Those paintings on the Wall Were--

988
01:19:38,818 --> 01:19:41,616
Could fetch a pretty penny
in the right circles.

989
01:19:42,021 --> 01:19:45,855
Jack, we don't know anybody
in the right circles.

990
01:19:46,025 --> 01:19:51,463
- I know plenty of people in plenty of circles.
- Why stop if you still don't believe me?

991
01:19:51,798 --> 01:19:53,959
I said to myself, "Maybe...

992
01:19:54,133 --> 01:19:57,466
...she's telling the truth.
Maybe she did come back to warn me.

993
01:19:57,637 --> 01:20:02,006
Part of me thinks she's trying to have me
picked off like a shooting gallery duck."

994
01:20:02,175 --> 01:20:06,134
Would I leave you the combination
if I was trying to get you killed?

995
01:20:06,312 --> 01:20:09,748
- Would I do that?
- You're practically my guardian angel.

996
01:20:13,286 --> 01:20:14,913
Come here. Give me a kiss.

997
01:20:15,488 --> 01:20:17,115
You Want a kiss?

998
01:20:17,290 --> 01:20:18,917
Just a little one.

999
01:20:19,492 --> 01:20:22,052
I'll give you a kiss for good luck.

1000
01:20:23,162 --> 01:20:24,823
Thank you.

1001
01:20:45,685 --> 01:20:47,312
Like Walter says:

1002
01:20:47,487 --> 01:20:49,478
"Sometimes you gotta have faith.

1003
01:20:49,655 --> 01:20:53,682
And a little luck never hurts. "

1004
01:20:54,305 --> 01:21:00,309
