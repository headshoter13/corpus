enough perhaps to challenge him.

Sauron fears this.

398
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:46,732
He will not risk the peoples of
Middle-earth uniting under one banner.

399
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,318
He will raze Minas Tirith
to the ground...

400
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:53,989
...before he sees a king
return to the throne of Men.

Why do you always have to look?

418
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:02,224
- I don't know. I can't help it.
- You never can.

419

I'm sorry, all right?

420
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:09,106
- I won't do it again.
- Don't you understand?

421
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,817
The enemy thinks you have the Ring.

422
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:15,737

- Pippin.

510
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:51,289
I offer you my service, such as it is...

511
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,833
...in payment of this debt.

512
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:59,338
This is my first command to you.

513
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:03,509
How did you escape
and my son did not...

514
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:06,179
...so mighty a man as he was?

515
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:10,183
The mightiest man
may be slain by one arrow...

516
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,351
...and Boromir was pierced by many.

517
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,191
Get up.

518
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:22,987
My lord, there will be a time
to grieve for Boromir...

519
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,198
...but it is not now.

520
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:28,117
War is coming.

521
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:32,872
The enemy is on your doorstep.
As steward, you are charged...

522
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:37,210
...with the defense of this city.
Where are Gondor's armies?

523
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:42,256
You still have friends.
You are not alone in this fight.

524
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:46,928
Send word to Théoden of Rohan.
Light the beacons.

525
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:52,058
You think you are wise, Mithrandir.

526
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:55,269
Yet for all your subtleties,
you have not wisdom.

527
00:46:57,397 --> 00:47:01,567
Do you think the eyes
of the White Tower are blind?

528
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:04,821
I have seen more than you know.

529
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:08,199
With your left hand you would use me
as a shield against Mordor.

530
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:11,244
And with your right
you'd seek to supplant me.

531
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:15,122
I know who rides with Théoden of Rohan.

532
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:21,254
Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears
of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

533
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:26,259
And I tell you now, I will not bow
to this Ranger from the North...

534
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:30,930
...last of a ragged house
long bereft of lordship.

535
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:36,936
Authority is not given to you
to deny the return of the king, steward.

536
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:41,524
The rule of Gondor is mine
and no other's.

537

<font color="#808080">GANDALF :</font>
Come.

538
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:59,000
All has turned to vain ambition.

539
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:02,628
He would even use his grief
as a cloak.

540
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:08,301
A thousand years
this city has stood.

541
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:11,804
Now, at the whim of a madman,
it will fall.

542
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:15,224
And the White Tree,
the tree of the king...

543
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:16,934
...will never bloom again.

545
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:21,022

They guard it because they have hope.

546
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:23,816
A faint and fading hope
that one day it will flower.

547
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:28,738
That a king will come
and this city will be as it once was...

548
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,824
...before it fell into decay.

549
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:35,244
The old wisdom borne out
of the West was forsaken.

550
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:39,707
Kings made tombs more splendid
than the houses of the living...

551
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,834
...and counted the old names
of their descent...

552
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:44,795
...dearer than the names of their sons.

553
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:50,009
Childless lords sat in aged halls,
musing on heraldry...

554
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:55,514
...or in high, cold towers,
asking questions of the stars.

555
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:59,477
And so the people of Gondor
fell into ruin.

556
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:02,772
The line of kings failed.

557
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:05,858
The White Tree withered.

558
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:10,738
The rule of Gondor was given over
to lesser men.

559
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,708
Mordor.

560
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:26,879
Yes, there it lies.

561
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:31,050

in the sight of its shadow.

This is not the weather of the world.

This is a device of Sauron's making.

566

A broil of fume
he sends ahead of his host.

567
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:47,650
The Orcs of Mordor
have no love of daylight...

568
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,652
...so he covers the face of the sun...

569

along the road to war.

reaches this city...

It must be getting near teatime.

I don't think I'll be coming back.

585
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,803
Yes, you will. Of course you will.

586
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:00,306
That's just morbid thinking.
